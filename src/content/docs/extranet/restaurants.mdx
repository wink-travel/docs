## Social media

:::note
This section is optional.
:::

Click on the `Social media` tab to continue.

You might be wondering, "Why does a restaurant have its own social media section?". A restaurant can also be a facility close to the property but off premises with its own staff and its own IG profile. 

Social media keeps you in touch with new and existing travelers over time. 
Add your social network accounts to your profile so guests can easily get in touch with you and learn about this restaurant. 

<Steps>
1. Toggle the switch of a social network you wish to enable.
2. Enter the name of your account on that network.
</Steps>

## Reputation

:::note
This section is optional.
:::

Click on the `Reputation` tab to continue.

Similar to the `Social media` tab, you would use this tab if this restaurant has a separate reputation score(s) or extra accolades that you want to highlight here.

Your reputation is your digital currency and you want to be able to take it with you wherever you go. 
A reputation entry can be anything your property wants to take credit for such as a 3rd party rating or for the bake-off where your chef won gold.
In this section, you can add your scores and rankings from all over the Internet.

Click the `Add reputation score` button.

<Steps>
1. ***Category*** Choose the type of score you want add. *e.g. Third party review*

## Attribute Based Selling

:::note
This section is optional.

Click on the `Attribute Based Selling` tab to continue.

All our facilities come with their own ABS section. This section lets you create upsell opportunities on the main inventory or make a non-transactional inventory type transactional.
We highly recommend you create these opportunities to potentially connect with the booker at a higher price point during the booking process.

:::tip
A restaurant can be made available for sale through ABS. It can be made available for sale in different ways:

- ***Featured*** Indicate whether this restaurant should be more prominently placed if the option presents itself.
- ***Attribute Based Selling*** Toggle switch to âœ… to enable ABS on this inventory. *Once enabled, you need to add at least 1 ABS item for sale*

### Ancillary item

When you enable ABS, you can start adding ancillary items and make them available for sale.

*By default, an empty item has already been created for you. You can add more by clicking the `Add item for sale` button.*

- ***Name*** Give your ancillary a name. *e.g. All you can eat*
- ***Pricing type*** Indicate how you want to calculate price. *e.g. Set to `Per hour` to indicate price is based on no. of hours rented.*

- ***Maximum quantity*** Restrict on the maximum quantity that need to get booked. *e.g. 4 attendees*

## Proximity

Click on the `Proximity` tab to continue.

Not all inventory is located on the premises. If you have inventory that is located off the premises, let the traveler know here and you will be given the chance to set a separate map location along with optional contact information.

*This can be helpful at times when a restaurant is located a few kilometers away from the hotel and the traveler wants to explain how to get there to the taxi driver.*
