Announcements are a way to notify your guests of important information in a way that gets noticed.
If an announcment is `triggered`, it shows up as a new window above your landing page.

To see your announcements, click on `Property > Announcement` in the main nav bar.

Click on `Create announcement` button to create a new entry.

<Steps>
1. Choose whether or not to include a title.
2. Announcements can be triggered in one of two ways:
    - Always display, every time someone visits your page.
    - Display only when the itinerary matches the announcement itinerary.
3. If you chose to only display announcement for a certain date range, add the dates in the form fields below.
4. Cilck the `Save` button and you will be taken back to your announcements.
