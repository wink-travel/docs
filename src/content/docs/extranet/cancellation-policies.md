To manage your Cancellation policies, click on `Monetize > Cancellation policies` from the main nav bar.

Cancellation policies determine how booker funds are handled in case the guest cannot make it. Cancellation policies come in two distinct flavors:

1. Refundable
2. Non-refundable

Most of the time, these two optons are enough. However, both give you a lot of room to customize your cancelation policy further. 

:::tip[Fun fact]
Wink supports a total of 8500 variations of cancellation policy.

To create a cancellation policy, click the `Create a new cancellation policy` button.

## Non-refundable

To create a non-refundable cancellation policy, set the switch to ðŸ›‘ off when asked if the policy is refundable.

### Options

You can optionally configure your `non-refundable` policy further for greater control.

- **How much is the guest charged for a cancellation?** By default, a non-refundable policy is a 100% non-refundable policy. You can fine-tune the amount here. *e.g. 50% of total price*
- **Does the charge have a deadline?** If you fine-tuned the amount, you can fine tune it further by setting how long that amount stays in effect. *e.g. Until 3 days prior to arrival*
- **How much is the guest charged for a cancellation after the deadline?** In case the guest goes past the deadline set above, you can set the amount the guest pays after the deadline. *e.g. 70% of the total price* 

## Refundable

To create a refundable cancellation policy, set the switch to âœ… on when asked if the policy is refundable.

### Options

You can optionally configure your `refundable` policy further for greater control.

- **How long, prior to arrival, can the guest cancel free of charge?** By default, a refundable policy is always 100% refundable. You can fine-tune the deadline here. *e.g. 3 days prior to arrival*
- **What should the guest be charged if the cancellation occurs after the deadline above?** If you fine-tuned the deadline, you can set the amount the guest pays after the deadline. *e.g. 50% of the total price* 
- **How much should the guest be charged for a 'No show?** In case the guest does not show up, you can set the amount the guest is charged for a `No show`. *e.g. 100% of the total price*
