GET THIS RIGHT

Minimum occupancy: i think we can all agree here that the minimum value is 1 but you can also decide to have a minimum of 2 person for certain room categories.
Included adult occupancy: this is very important to get it right. How many adult are actually “included” with this room or you could say allowed to stay without extra charge; which is different from the actual maximum number of adult allowed in this room (section 4). This will be determinant if you want to charge $$ for extra adult.
Maximum occupancy: this is the maximum number of occupant child and adult combined.
Maximum adult occupancy: this value determine the total number of adult allowed to stay in this room.
Included child occupancy: this is very important to get it right too. How many child are actually allowed to stay with their parents without extra charge. Which is different from the actual maximum number of child allowed in this room (section 6). This will be determinant if you want to charge $$ for extra child.
Maximum child occupancy: this value determine the total number of child allowed to stay in this room.
