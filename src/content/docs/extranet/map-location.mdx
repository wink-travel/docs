You will be asked to set your map location during setup.

To manage your property's map location, click on `Property > Map location` in the main navigation tab.

You can set your map location in two ways:

1. Search for your property by name in the search field above the map and select it.
2. Using the map, zoom and pan your way to the location of your property and click on the map when you find it.

A map marker will appear with your updated coordinates.
