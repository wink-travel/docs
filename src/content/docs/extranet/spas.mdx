Spas let you showcase and sell your spas, on and off the premises. To create a spa, click the `Create spa` button.

The following sections step you through every part of managing a spa.

## Configuration

The `Configurations` tab is selected by default when you get started.

This section covers the basics of your spa. 

- **Internal name** The name of the spa, as you refer to it internally. *e.g. Santika Spa*

This section lets you manage when the spa is readily available.

### Operating hours

- **Opens** Time of day when spa becomes available. *e.g. 09:00*
- **Closes** Time of day when spa becomes unavailable. *e.g. 21:00*

### Days of operation

This section lets you set the days of the week when the spa is available.

*Toggle the switch to âœ… to indicate that the day is available.*

### Seasonal

## Social media

:::note
This section is optional.
:::

Click on the `Social media` tab to continue.

You might be wondering, "Why does a spa have its own social media section?". A spa can also be a facility close to the property but off premises with its own staff and its own IG profile. 

Social media keeps you in touch with new and existing travelers over time. 
Add your social network accounts to your profile so guests can easily get in touch with you and learn about this spa. 

<Steps>
1. Toggle the switch of a social network you wish to enable.
2. Enter the name of your account on that network.
</Steps>

## Reputation

:::note
This section is optional.
:::

Click on the `Reputation` tab to continue.

Similar to the `Social media` tab, you would use this tab if this spa has a separate reputation score(s) or extra accolades that you want to highlight here.

Your reputation is your digital currency and you want to be able to take it with you wherever you go. 
A reputation entry can be anything your property wants to take credit for such as a 3rd party rating or for the bake-off where your chef won gold.
In this section, you can add your scores and rankings from all over the Internet.

Click the `Add reputation score` button.

<Steps>
1. **Category** Choose the type of score you want add. *e.g. Third party review*
2. **Provider** Type in who awarded you the score. *e.g. BigOTA.com*
3. **Rating type** Select the form in which you received the score. *e.g. Numeric*
4. **Date** Optionally, enter the date you received the score.
5. **Rating** Enter the score you received. *e.g. 8.5*
6. **Max rating** Optionally, enter the max score possible for this type of award. *e.g. 10*
</Steps>

## Attribute Based Selling

Click on the `Attribute Based Selling` tab to continue.

All our facilities come with their own ABS section. This section lets you create upsell opportunities on the main inventory or make a non-transactional inventory type transactional.
We highly recommend you create these opportunities to potentially connect with the booker at a higher price point during the booking process.

## Proximity

Click on the `Proximity` tab to continue.

Not all inventory is located on the premises. If you have inventory that is located off the premises, let the traveler know here and you will be given the chance to set a separate map location along with optional contact information.

*This can be helpful at times when a spa is located a few kilometers away from the hotel and the traveler wants to explain how to get there to the taxi driver.*
