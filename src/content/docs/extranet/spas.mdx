Spas let you showcase and sell your spas, on and off the premises. To create a spa, click the `Create spa` button.

The following sections step you through every part of managing a spa.

### Days of operation

This section lets you set the days of the week when the spa is available.

*Toggle the switch to ✅ to indicate that the day is available.*

## Social media

:::note
This section is optional.
:::

Click on the `Social media` tab to continue.

You might be wondering, "Why does a spa have its own social media section?". A spa can also be a facility close to the property but off premises with its own staff and its own IG profile.

Social media keeps you in touch with new and existing travelers over time.
Add your social network accounts to your profile so guests can easily get in touch with you and learn about this spa.

<Steps>
1. Toggle the switch of a social network you wish to enable.
2. Enter the name of your account on that network.
</Steps>

## Reputation

:::note
This section is optional.
:::

Click on the `Reputation` tab to continue.

Similar to the `Social media` tab, you would use this tab if this spa has a separate reputation score(s) or extra accolades that you want to highlight here.

Your reputation is your digital currency and you want to be able to take it with you wherever you go.
A reputation entry can be anything your property wants to take credit for such as a 3rd party rating or for the bake-off where your chef won gold.
In this section, you can add your scores and rankings from all over the Internet.

Click the `Add reputation score` button.

<Steps>
1. **Category** Choose the type of score you want add. *e.g. Third party review*
2. **Provider** Type in who awarded you the score. *e.g. BigOTA.com*
