Every booking journey starts with a guest room. There are a lot of features around guest rooms and it can be a bit overwhelming at first.
This article will cover everything you need to know in order to become a Wink guest room specialist.

Guest rooms, or room types as they say in `the biz`, let you showcase and sell your rooms, on and off the premises. To create a guest room, click the `Create a new guest room` button.

The following sections step you through every part of managing a guest room.

## Configuration

The `Configurations` tab is selected by default when you get started.

This section covers the basics of your guest room in order for us to know who we can sell this room to.

- **Room type name** The name of the room, as you refer to it internally. *e.g. Supreme deluxe*
- **Non-smoking** Whether the room is non-smoking or not.
- **Rack rate** The published rate for one night's stay without any discounts or premiums included. *e.g. 100. Note that we only use this number to showcase expected price to sales channels or to pre-populate certain fields when you are filling out forms.*
- **Best available rate** The best available rate for one night's stay without any discounts or premiums included. *e.g. 75. Note that we only use this number to showcase expected price to sales channels or to pre-populate certain fields when you are filling out forms.*
- **Quantity** The number of units you have of this room type on any given day. *e.g. 40*

### Occupancy

:::caution
Occupancy plays a large part in whether your guest room shows up as available for a specific itinerary. Many of these fields will be auto-populated when you first create the room. Make sure you modify them to fit your room type.
:::

- **Min. occupancy** The minimum number of persons allowed to stay in this room. *e.g. 1*
- **Included adult occupancy** Number of adults included in the price of a room night. *e.g. 2. Note: If the room supports more than this number, they are calculated using the `Extra adult` modifier on your rate plan.*
- **Max occupancy** The maximum number of persons (adults + children) allowed to stay in this room. *e.g. 4*
- **Max adult occupancy** The maximum number of adults allowed to stay in this room. *e.g. 3*
- **Included child occupancy** Number of children included in the price of a room night. *e.g. 1. Note: If the room supports more than this number, they are calculated using the `Extra child` modifier on your rate plan.*
- **Max child occupancy** The maximum number of children allowed to stay in this room. *e.g. 2*

:::

Click on the `Bedrooms` tab to continue.

The bedrooms section allows you to specify the layout of your bedroom(s) and indicate what is in each one.

Guest rooms of the same type can have multiple layouts, or `Bedding configurations`. A guest room, needs at least one layout.

You can have multiple bedrooms within a layout.

Within a bedroom, you can have multiple beds of different types and quantities.

- **Quantity** Choose the number of beds of this bed type in this bedroom. *e.g. 1*

Similar to property amenities, guest room amenities applies to the specific guest room only. Check each amenity that applies.

## Descriptions

Click on the `Descriptions` tab to continue.

Similar to property welcome text, you can create localized descriptions for the guest room as well.
You can write in as many languages as you wants. We will add translations for all the most popular languages.
This is the text travelers will see when viewing your guest rooms.

- **Name** Give the guest room a name. *e.g. Supreme deluxe*
- **Description** Describe the guest room in a paragraph or two. *e.g. This is the best guest room in the whole world...*

## Social media

:::note
This section is optional.
:::

Click on the `Social media` tab to continue.

You might be wondering, "Why does a guest room have its own social media section?". A guest room can also be a villa close to the property but off premises with its own staff and its own IG profile.

Social media keeps you in touch with new and existing travelers over time.
Add your social network accounts to your profile so guests can easily get in touch with you and learn more about your guest room.

<Steps>
1. Toggle the switch of a social network you wish to enable.
2. Enter the name of your account on that network.
</Steps>

## Reputation

:::note
This section is optional.
:::

Click on the `Reputation` tab to continue.

Similar to the `Social media` tab, you would use this tab if this guest room has a separate reputation score(s) or extra accolades that you want to highlight here.

Your reputation is your digital currency and you want to be able to take it with you wherever you go.
A reputation entry can be anything your property wants to take credit for such as a 3rd party rating or for the bake-off where your chef won gold.
In this section, you can add your scores and rankings from all over the Internet.

Click the `Add reputation score` button.

<Steps>
1. **Category** Choose the type of score you want add. *e.g. Third party review*
2. **Provider** Type in who awarded you the score. *e.g. BigOTA.com*
3. **Rating type** Select the form in which you received the score. *e.g. Numeric*
4. **Date** Optionally, enter the date you received the score.
5. **Rating** Enter the score you received. *e.g. 8.5*
6. **Max rating** Optionally, enter the max score possible for this type of award. *e.g. 10*
</Steps>

## Attribute Based Selling

:::note
This section is optional.
:::

Click on the `Attribute Based Selling` tab to continue.

All our facilities come with their own ABS section. This section lets you create upsell opportunities on the main inventory or make a non-transactional inventory type transactional.
We highly recommend you create these opportunities to potentially connect with the booker at a higher price point during the booking process.

:::tip
A guest room comes with plenty of things to include as ancillaries:

- Superior mattress.
- Deluxe bathroom kit.
- Marshal Bluetooth speaker.
- Working desk with extra comfortable chair.
- In-room breakfast
- In-room massage
- 12-pack of beer
- Bottle of wine
- Premium chocolate
- +++ let your imagination run wild and earn some extra money!!
:::

- **Price point** Give the traveler a quick indication of how expensive this guest room is. That's right... for the guest room. Not the ancillary.
- **Active** Toggle switch to ðŸ›‘ if you want this guest room to become unavailable to book across all master rates and sales channels.
- **Commissionable** Indicate whether the affiliates makes a commission on this inventory.
- **Featured** Indicate whether this guest room should be more prominently placed if the option presents itself.
- **Attribute Based Selling** Toggle switch to âœ… to enable ABS on this inventory. *Once enabled, you need to add at least 1 ABS item for sale*

### Ancillary item

When you enable ABS, you can start adding ancillary items and make them available for sale.

*By default, an empty item has already been created for you. You can add more by clicking the `Add item for sale` button.*

- **Name** Give your ancillary a name. *e.g. Champagne chocolate truffles by Royce*
- **Pricing type** Indicate how you want to calculate price. *e.g. Paddleboard rental. Set to `Per hour` to indicate price is based on no. of hours rented.*
- **Base price** Enter the regular price of this item. *e.g. 20 / hour*
- **Discounted price** Enter the price Wink users get when booking the item alongside the room. *e.g. 15 / hour*

### Limits

You can restrict the availability of this item by setting min / max limits on quantity.
If we continue our example of renting a paddle board by the hour but we want to require the guest to book at least 2 boards at the same time, we would:

- **Minimum quantity** Restrict on the minimum quantity that need to get booked. *e.g. 2 paddle boards*
- **Maximum quantity** Restrict on the maximum quantity that need to get booked. *e.g. leave empty for no max restriction*

### Descriptions

:::note
You need to write at least one description and it needs to be in the English language.
:::

- **Name** Give your ancillary a name. *e.g. Stand Up Paddleboard*
- **Description** Describe the ancillary in a paragraph or two. *e.g. Don.t just sit around - Get your paddle on!*

### Photos & Videos

To add a new photo or video to your ancillary:

<PhotosAndVideosText/>

## Proximity

Click on the `Proximity` tab to continue.

Not all inventory is located on the premises. If you have inventory that is located off the premises, let the traveler know here and you will be given the chance to set a separate map location along with optional contact information.

*This can be helpful at times when a villa that is owned by the hotel but is located a few kilometers away from the hotel and the traveler wants to explain how to get there to the taxi driver.*

Click the `Save` button to continue.
