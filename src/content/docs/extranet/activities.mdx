Activities let you showcase and sell your activities, on and off the premises. To create a activity, click the `Create activity` button.

The following sections step you through every part of managing a activity.

### Days of operation

This section lets you set the days of the week when the activity is available.

*Toggle the switch to âœ… to indicate that the day is available.*

Similar to property amenities, activity amenities applies to the specific activity only. Check each amenity that applies.

## Descriptions

You can write in as many languages as you wants. We will add translations for all the most popular languages.
This is the text travelers will see when viewing your activities.

## Social media

:::note
This section is optional.
:::

Click on the `Social media` tab to continue.

You might be wondering, "Why does a activity have its own social media section?". A activity can also be a facility close to the property but off premises with its own staff and its own IG profile. 

Social media keeps you in touch with new and existing travelers over time. 
Add your social network accounts to your profile so guests can easily get in touch with you and learn about this activity. 

<Steps>
1. Toggle the switch of a social network you wish to enable.
2. Enter the name of your account on that network.
</Steps>

## Reputation

:::note
This section is optional.
:::

Click on the `Reputation` tab to continue.

Similar to the `Social media` tab, you would use this tab if this activity has a separate reputation score(s) or extra accolades that you want to highlight here.

Your reputation is your digital currency and you want to be able to take it with you wherever you go. 
A reputation entry can be anything your property wants to take credit for such as a 3rd party rating or for the bake-off where your chef won gold.
In this section, you can add your scores and rankings from all over the Internet.

Click the `Add reputation score` button.

<Steps>
1. ***Category*** Choose the type of score you want add. *e.g. Third party review*
2. ***Provider*** Type in who awarded you the score. *e.g. BigOTA.com*
3. ***Rating type*** Select the form in which you received the score. *e.g. Numeric*
4. ***Date*** Optionally, enter the date you received the score.
5. ***Rating*** Enter the score you received. *e.g. 8.5*
6. ***Max rating*** Optionally, enter the max score possible for this type of award. *e.g. 10*
</Steps>

## Attribute Based Selling

:::note
This section is optional.
:::

Click on the `Attribute Based Selling` tab to continue.

All our facilities come with their own ABS section. This section lets you create upsell opportunities on the main inventory or make a non-transactional inventory type transactional.
We highly recommend you create these opportunities to potentially connect with the booker at a higher price point during the booking process.

:::tip
A activity can be made available for sale through ABS. It can be made available for sale in different ways:

- Day trip.
- 3-day trip.
- +++ let your imagination run wild and earn some extra money!!

- ***Price point*** Give the traveler a quick indication of how expensive this activity is.
- ***Active*** Toggle switch to ðŸ›‘ if you want this activity to become unavailable to book across all sales channels.
- ***Commissionable*** Indicate whether the affiliates makes a commission on this inventory.
- ***Featured*** Indicate whether this activity should be more prominently placed if the option presents itself.
- ***Attribute Based Selling*** Toggle switch to âœ… to enable ABS on this inventory. *Once enabled, you need to add at least 1 ABS item for sale*

### Ancillary item

When you enable ABS, you can start adding ancillary items and make them available for sale.

*By default, an empty item has already been created for you. You can add more by clicking the `Add item for sale` button.*

- ***Name*** Give your ancillary a name. *e.g. Day trip*
- ***Pricing type*** Indicate how you want to calculate price. *e.g. Set to `Per day` to indicate price is based on no. of days.*
- ***Base price*** Enter the regular price of this item. *e.g. 200 / day*
- ***Discounted price*** Enter the price Wink users get when booking the item. *e.g. 150 / day*

### Limits

You can restrict the availability of this item by setting min / max limits on quantity. 

- ***Minimum quantity*** Restrict on the minimum quantity that need to get booked. *e.g. 1 attendees*
- ***Maximum quantity*** Restrict on the maximum quantity that need to get booked. *e.g. 4 attendees*

### Descriptions

:::note
You need to write at least one description and it needs to be in the English language.
:::

- ***Name*** Give your ancillary a name. *e.g. Day trip*
- ***Description*** Describe the ancillary in a paragraph or two. *e.g. Take a day off and head to the river.*

<PhotosAndVideosText/>

## Proximity

Click on the `Proximity` tab to continue.

Not all inventory is located on the premises. If you have inventory that is located off the premises, let the traveler know here and you will be given the chance to set a separate map location along with optional contact information.

*This can be helpful at times when a activity is located a few kilometers away from the hotel and the traveler wants to explain how to get there to the taxi driver.*

Click the `Save` button to continue.
