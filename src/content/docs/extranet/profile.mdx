The property profile is a required step in our onboarding wizard and gives us a chance to get to know your property better using criteria, such as:

- Number of stars.
- Type of hotel.
- Location type.
- ...and more

To manage your property profile, click on `Property > Profile` in the main navigation tab.

Update the form and click the `Save` button to continue.
