[Wink Extranet](https://extranet.wink.travel) is our property portal. It's meant for hotels, chains, brands and hotel management companies to create and manage the digital profile of their properties on the Wink platform.

Our Extranet has been thoughtfully designed to be as simple as possible, but to still support all the features power users have come to expect from an advanced property portal. To give you a couple of examples:

1. Simplicity: Use our intelligent onboarding workflow to onboard your property and go LIVE in less than an hour.
2. Advanced: Wink supports 8500 different variations of cancellation policies
3. Cool: Give a single person on planet earth 10% off without the user having to log in or type in a promo code.

Let our wizards guide you through the entire process. When you feel comfortable enough... go at it alone.

Wink is an advanced content management system for properties and experience providers. Everything you can do in one of our apps, you can do via API. This allows you to do a deep integration with Wink to such an extent that you can sell through Wink without ever having to log into any of our apps.

Are you paying for expensive media asset hosting through Leonardo International? You can do the exact same thing through Wink AND you get many more options to manipulate and fine tune your images and videos.

All these features come at no cost to you. It's only when you make a booking that we take a small fee. Nothing to lose - Everything to gain.
