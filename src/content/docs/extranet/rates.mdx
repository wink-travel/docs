This article walks you through all you need to know about how rates work on Wink.

## Features

:::note
Wink manages rates at the master rate level and not the guest room level. This gives you added flexibility in how you choose to allocate rooms.
:::

A rate on Wink supports the following data points:

- **Quantity** Number of units available.
- **Rate amount** Base price.
- **Available** Whether rate is available for that date or not.
- **Closed on Arrival (COA)** Whether guests can arrive on this date.
- **Closed on Departure (COD)** Whether guests can depart on this date.
- **Minimum length of stay (Min LoS)** Whether there is a minimum LoS requirement.
- **Maximum length of stay (Max LoS)** Whether there is a maximum LoS requirement.
- **Minimum occupancy** Whether there is a minimum occupancy requirement.
- **Maximum occupancy** Whether there is a maximum LoS requirement.

Below data points are only available through a rate provider:

*If you rate provider does not support these data points, you can still control them through your rate plans on Wink.*

- Single occupant rate modifier
- Extra adult rate modifier
- Extra child rate modifier

Rates are at the core of Wink. Properties can add rates manually or connect their rate provider.

## Manual entry

:::caution
Only create / update rates manually if you are not selling your room types on any other platform than Wink.
:::

:::caution
If you update rates manually, when connected to a rate provider, the rates will change again the moment your rate provider sends us an update for the same date range.

### Single date entries

You can update single and multiple date entries by changing the values in the calendar (*see above*). When you make a change, a `Save` button will display underneath the calendar that lets you save your changes.

### Bulk updates

You can make bulk changes to a calendar by opening up the bulk editor and make changes across a date range.

## Via rate provider

To start sending us rates via your rate provider, follow these steps:

- First make sure that we support your [rate provider](/extranet/rate-providers).
- Set your rate provider under `Distribution > Channel manager`.
- Log into your rate provider.
- Add the `Wink` channel to your rate provider dashboard.
- Map your room types / rate plans to the ones you created in Wink.
- Initiate a full rate push to Wink [if not done so automatically by rate provider].

Wait about 3-5 mins to see your Wink master rate calendars fill up with rates.

## Verifier

You can test your rate setup by navigating to `Distribution > Verifier` from the main nav bar.

On this page, you can simulate any type of price request a traveler might do.

:::tip
If you can't find the setting you are looking for, click on the `Advanced search` button at the bottom of the page.
:::

### Example

Below is a sample itinerary over one of your existing sales channels:

- **Channel** Choose the sales channel you want to sell through. *e.g. Traveliko OTA*.
- **Currency** Choose the display currency. *e.g. USD*
- **Stay start date** Enter the arrival date. *e.g. Sept. 10th 2024*
- **Nights** Enter number of nights. *e.g. 1*
- **Guests** Enter adults / children visiting. *e.g. 2 adults*
- Click the `Search` button to continue.

      errorImage="noimage_opaque_nyrtl0.png"
    />
    <figcaption>*Rate verifier search result*</figcaption>
</figure>

You will see all your guest rooms show up in the search results.
If there is no availability or no access, you will be able to see where, in the workflow, it became unavailable.

*e.g. You have no availability because you set your master rate to unavailable across all sales channels.*

Above is a sample search result with availability as well as a channel / member discount and a promotional discount.
You can verify that prices display as they should for the conditions you test.

### Test booking

    />
    <figcaption>*Test booking confirmation window*</figcaption>
</figure>

You can test your entire workflow from end-to-end by creating a test booking.
A test booking is marked as `test` and does not secure the booking with a credit card or other payment method.

Test booking options include:

- **Notify property via email** This triggers sending the property an e-mail confirmation.
- **Notify channel manager via API** This triggers sending the booking to your selected rate provider.
- **Notify booker via email** This triggers sending the booker e-mail confirmation.

By default, the booker in this scenario is you, the authenticated user. You can also choose to add custom booker details by enabling the `Add custom booker details` switch and filling out the form.

*If you selected to have us notify your rate provider, the rate provider will treat this booking as any other booking and will not know that it is a test. We recommend testing with refundable rates for easy cancellation after testing is complete.*

## API

Developers who want to manage `Rates` can head over to [Developers > APIs > Monetize](/developers/apis/#monetize-api).
