Rate plans are the filter through which guest rooms are presented to users.
It also contains settings that control the pricing structure under certain scenarios.

Rate plans let you:

- Set a cancellation policy [and policy exceptions].
- Price in extra children, adults and single travelers.
- Set meals.
- Add early check-in and late checkout charges.
- Set additional charges.
- Set restrictions.

To create a rate plan, click the `Create a new rate plan` button.

## Configuration

The `Configurations` tab is selected by default when you get started.

This section covers the basic options to configure your rate plan.

Set additional charges that accompany the rate plan.

- **Early check-in** Set an additional charge when the guest wants to check in early. *This is for informational use only*

To create an extra charge, click the `Create extra charge` button.

*Example: Enabling Monday requires that the guest arrive on a Monday.*

This restriction goes well with the "Stay date restriction" where you can limit on the date range and further limit the days of the week using this restriction.
:::

By enabling this restriction, guests MUST depart on that day in order to see this rate.

*Example: Enabling Monday requires that the guest depart on a Monday.*

*Example: Enabling Monday requires guests to stay over on a Monday.*
