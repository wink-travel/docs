On this page, you will learn everything you need to know about how to create and manage properties on Wink.

:::note
This assume you have already create a property account in [my.wink.travel](https://my.wink.travel).
:::

Choose your property from the `Accounts` grid and from `Actions` select to `Go to Extranet`. This forwards you to the Extranet dashboard with your property selected.

## Wizard

If you have required sections that still haven't been completed, the `Wizard` will display on the left side and tell you which step[s] you need to complete.

## Dashboard

Once your property has been created, you can finalize your profile creation or start managing your property by clicking on the `Manage` link in your list of properties.
This takes you to the property dashboard.

The dashboard is home base for your property. It consists of sections to help you navigate and get the most out of our tools:

### How am I doing?

This section gives you a quick glance at the health of your property. It tells you:

- Total number of bookings
- Average booking value
- Total sales amount

These numbers include all bookings made from any sales channel on the Wink network.

### Wink network requests

You can find pending requests from affiliates that want to connect with you in this section.
There is also a link there that takes you directly to `Distribution > Explore network` so you can manage all your current and pending sales channels.

### Tasks

The tasks section shows you optional, but recommended, things you can do to make your property profile stand out more.

*We recommend adding your online reputation scores from any external site you have a rating on, such as up-to-date ratings from large OTAs.*

### Analytics

A new property automatically receives their own basics analytics at the time of creation. By default, you will see:

- Net revenue for the last 12 months.
- Average booking value for the last 12 months.
- Total page views for the last 12 months.
- Total bookings for the last 12 months.
- Total cancellations for the last 12 months.

These charts can easily be modified. However, these charts contain all the analytics your property will need for a while.
