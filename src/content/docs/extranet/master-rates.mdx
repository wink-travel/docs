:::note
Creating your first master rate is part of the onboarding wizard.

:::note
A `master rate` is a unique `guest room / rate plan` pair.

*Most travel rate providers only use guest room and rate plan in this context. When you see your guest room listed for sale on OTAs or booking engines, travelers will be comparing rate plans.*

Wink added the term `master rate` to be able to give the unique combination more flexibility.
:::

:::note
Master rates are created / removed automatically when a guest room or rate plan is added or removed.

To manage your Master Rates, click on `Monetize > Master Rate` from the top navigation bar.

A property will have a master rate for every guest room / rate plan combination.

*Example: If your property has one guest room and two rate plans, the guest will see two master rates available for sale (if all conditions are met).*

A master rate entry comes with two options to manage:

- Toggle master rate availability.
- Set perks.

## Availability

When you enable / disable  a master rate, it affects availability across all your sales channels. This switch is a quick way to turn a specific master rate off everywhere, immediately.

## Perks

When travelers are looking to book a guest room, they don't interact with the guest room directly. Instead, they interact with the master rate of that guest room.
A master rate can be loaded with unique perks that are only available for the specific guest room / rate plan combo; thereby giving property owners another way to incentivize that combo. 

Two things to keep in mind when choosing a perk: 

- Whether it's guaranteed or based upon availability.
- Its numeric value.

A guaranteed perk comes with a higher numeric value as it represents a greater value to customers. 
Every hotel will receive a `perk score` that's based on the aggregate numeric value of all perks across all master rates.
Travelers looking for a deal can sort on hotels with high perk scores. 

Perks are a way to:

- Differentiate the guest room / rate plan combo.
- Achieve greater visibility. *i.e. Score higher on the perk score scale than other hotels in your area.*

:::tip
Perks came from the desire for hotels to differentiate themselves and `game the system`. 
Last time they did that, they literally killed themselves by giving away all their profits to OTAs for better placement through higher commissions. 
Historically, commissions were the only thing for hotels to gamify on.

Perks are a way for hotels to reward travelers that don't necessarily have a real cost for hotels.

If you have suggestions for other types of perks to give away, [get in touch with us](mailto:hi@wink.travel).

There are two ways of enabling inventory for a sales channel:

- Toggle inventory availability on the card. *See figure above*
- Navigate to `Distribution > Inventory` from the top navigation bar dedicated to managing inventory across all sales channel.
