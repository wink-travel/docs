Sales channels are your existing affiliate relationships, codified with the inventory, deals and discounts they have access to.

To update an existing sales channel, click the `Actions` link under the sales channel you wish to update.

- **Member discount** The member rate is given to travelers who book through this sales channel.
- **Commission** The commission is allocated the sales channel for every successful booking.
- **Single promotions** Add the promotions you would like this sales channel to have.
- **Bundled promotions** Add the bundled promotions you would like this sales channel to have.
- **Enabled** Toggle the enabled switch to enable / disable the sales channel completely.
- **Blacklisted** Flagging a sales channel as blacklisted makes it impossible to book through this sales channel. 

Once you are happy with your settings, click the `Save` button to continue.

:::tip 
By blacklisting a sales channel, you make it impossible for the sales channel to get any rates from you whatsoever; even your Wink Network rates.

## Explore network

To find new affiliates on Wink, click on `Distribution > Explore network` from the top navigation bar.

In this section, you can see pending requests from affiliates on the top part of the page and a list of affiliates to connect to below.

### Respond to request

You can choose to reject the affiliate request. If you want to continue with the request, you will be taken to the `affiliate details` page where you can get more information about the affiliate as well as past performance metrics on Wink.

### Search for affiliates

In the affiliate grid, you can search for affiliates by name, type and location. When you see one you like, click on it and it takes you to the `affiliate details` page.

### Connect with affiliate

If you choose to establish a direct relationship with an affiliate, you will be asked to codify the relationship the same way you would manage a sales channel above.

Once you save the new sales channel, you are taken back to your list of sales channels.
