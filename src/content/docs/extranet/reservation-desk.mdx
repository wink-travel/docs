You will be asked for the contact details of your reservation desk during setup.

To manage your reservation desk, click on `Property > Reservation Desk` in the main navigation tab.

Update the form and click the `Save` button to continue.

:::note
It's not required to use a specific name of the main person at your front desk. It just adds to the familiarity of the place.
Incoming guests would love to connect with a real person upon arrival and be able to ask something like "Hi... is Lisa here?"
