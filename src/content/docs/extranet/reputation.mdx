Your reputation is your digital currency and you want to be able to take it with you wherever you go.
A reputation entry can be anything your property wants to take credit for such as a 3rd party rating or for the bake-off where your chef won gold.
In this section, you can add your scores and rankings from all over the Internet.

To manage your reputation, click on `Property > Reputation` in the main navigation tab.

Click the `Add reputation score` button.

1. **Category** Choose the type of score you want add. *e.g. Third party review*
2. **Provider** Type in who awarded you the score. *e.g. BigOTA.com*
3. **Rating type** Select the form in which you received the score. *e.g. Numeric*
4. **Date** Optionally, enter the date you received the score.
5. **Rating** Enter the score you received. *e.g. 8.5*
