**PAYMENT TERMS FOR ACCOMMODATION PROVIDERS**

These Payment Terms of Service (“**Payment Terms**”) are a binding legal agreement between Accommodation Provider and TripPay (herein after referred to as **“Payment Facilitator”**), a fully owned subsidiary of Traveliko Singapore Pte. Ltd., that governs the Payment Services (defined below) conducted through or in connection with Wink Platform (herein after referred to as **“Wink”**). When these Payment Terms mention “**Payment Facilitator**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**,” it refers to the TripPay company you are contracting with for Payment Services.

Payment Facilitator provides payments services to Accommodation Providers who are selling inventory through the Wink platform. These payment services may include (if available) the following (collectively, “**Payment Services**”):

* Collecting payments from Guests (“Pay-in”), by charging the payment method associated with their purchase, such as credit card, debit card, bank transfer, cryptocurrencies, or PayPal (“Payment Method”);  
* Effecting payments to Accommodation Providers (“Pay-out”);  
* Payment collection services; and  
* Other payment-related services in connection with Accommodation Provider Services.

To use the Payment Services, you must be at least 18 years of age, have a Wink account in good standing in accordance with the Payment Facilitator Terms, and keep your payment and personal information accurate and complete.

The Agreement has been read, and all the Terms and Conditions have been agreed upon by the Accommodation Provider. The Accommodation Provider explicitly agrees that electronic acceptance of this Agreement and its Terms and Conditions, including those related to modifications, is valid, binding, and enforceable.

The Payment Services will be provided by the contracting entity depending on the country in which the Accommodation is located as follows:

* United States: TripPay Corporation, 30 N. Gould St, Suite 22578, Sheridan, WY 82801\.  
* Rest of the world: TripPay Slovakia

**1\. Your Use of the Payment Services**

1.1 **Payment Facilitator Services**. By using the Payment Services, you agree to comply with these Payment Terms. Payment Facilitator may temporarily limit or suspend your access to or use of the Payment Services or its features to carry out maintenance measures that ensure the proper functioning of the Payment Services. Payment Facilitator may improve, enhance, and modify the Payment Services and introduce new Payment Services from time to time. Payment Facilitator will provide notice to Accommodation Providers of any changes to the Payment Services unless such changes do not materially increase the Accommodation Provider's contractual obligations or decrease the Accommodation Provider's rights under these Payment Terms.

1.2 **Verification**. You authorize Payment Facilitator, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries we consider necessary to verify your identity. This may include (i) screening you against third-party databases or other sources, (ii) requesting reports from service providers, (iii) asking you to provide a form of government identification (e.g., driver’s license or passport), your date of birth, your address, and other information; or (iv) requiring you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address, Payment Method(s) or Pay-out Method(s). Payment Facilitator reserves the right to terminate, suspend, or limit access to the Payment Services in the event we are unable to obtain or verify any of this information.

1.3 **Additional Terms**. Your access to or use of certain Payment Services may be subject to, or require you to accept, additional terms and conditions. If there is a conflict between these Payment Terms and terms and conditions applicable to a specific Payment Service, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your use of or access to that Payment Service unless specified otherwise.

1.4 **Bank Account Information**. Accommodation Provider shall ensure that its bank account details provided to Wink are accurate at all times, and it shall notify without delay of any changes to such.

Only the person signing this agreement shall be the sole designated representative of the Accommodation Provider who shall have the authority to request changes to the Accommodation Provider's bank account and/or payee information. No other person shall have such authority on behalf of the Accommodation Provider. Any change of such designated person shall be requested to Wink in writing, and any such change shall be implemented only via a written amendment to this Agreement executed by both Parties.

**2\. Collecting and Disbursing Payments**

2.1 **Collecting and Disbursing Payment**. Payment Facilitator collects the payment from guests on the Accommodation Provider’s behalf (Pay-in). Pay-in fees occur based on the guest's payment method (e.g., Visa, PayPal) and currency conversion (the “Pay-in Fees”), if and when applicable. When funds become available for Pay-out, Pay-out fees occur, including bank charges and currency conversion (the “Pay-out Fees”), if and when applicable.

2.2 **Payment Services Fees**. Payment Facilitator charges 4% of the total booking for Payment Services.

2.3 **Availability of Funds**. Subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the payments from the Guest, Payment Facilitator will make the funds associated with a booking available to the Accommodation Provider no later than 15 days after the Guest’s scheduled check-out date.

2.4 **Pay-out**. The Pay-out to your local bank account or by virtual credit card for a booking will be the total booking value minus Payment Services Fees (4%), Wink Booking Fee (1.5%), and partner commission if and when applicable as defined in the Accommodation Providers Terms & Conditions. In the event of cancellation of a confirmed booking, Payment Facilitator will remit the amount you are due (if any) as provided in the terms and applicable cancellation policy.

2.5 **Pay-out Data Requirements**. To receive a Pay-out to your local bank account or via virtual credit card associated with your Payment Facilitator account, you must provide billing information such as company details, name, government identification, tax ID, billing address, and financial instrument information either to Payment Facilitator or its third-party payment processor(s). Additional information may be required, such as a residential address, name on the account, account type, routing number, account number, email address, identification number, and account information associated with a particular payment processor. You authorize Payment Facilitator to collect and store your billing information and financial instrument information. Payment Facilitator may also share your information with governmental authorities as required by applicable law.

2.6 **Pay-out Restrictions**. Payment Facilitator may temporarily place a hold, suspend, or cancel any Pay-out to prevent unlawful activity or fraud, for risk assessment, security, or completing an investigation; or if we are unable to verify your identity. Furthermore, Payment Facilitator may temporarily place a hold on, suspend, or delay initiating or processing any Pay-out due to you under the Terms as a result of high volume Booking cancellations or modifications arising from a Force Majeure Event (as defined below).

2.7 **Limits on Pay-outs**. For compliance or operational reasons, Payment Facilitator may limit the amount of a Pay-out. If you are due an amount above that limit, Payment Facilitator may make a series of Pay-outs (potentially over multiple days) to provide your full Pay-out amount.

2.8 **Currency Conversion**. Payment Facilitator will remit your Pay-outs in the currency you have selected via the Payment Facilitator. The currencies available may be limited for regulatory or operational reasons based on your country of residence and/or your Payment Facilitator contracting entity(ies). Any such limitations will be communicated via Payment Facilitator, and you will be prompted to select a different currency. Payment Facilitator uses USD, EUR, and GBP as standard currencies to receive and pay funds. Any transactions involving other currencies will incur currency conversion costs.

2.9 **Handling of Funds**. Payment Facilitator may combine amounts it collects from Guests and invest them as permitted under applicable laws. Payment Facilitator will retain any interest it earns on those investments.

2.10 **Affiliate’s Accuracy**. The Accommodation Provider is responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the bank information maintained in the Payment Facilitator’s profile. If the bank account number is provided incorrectly, an additional processing fee will be levied by the banks. Payment Facilitator will deduct this processing fee from the next Commission payment. In the case that the bank account provided by the Affiliate is closed or frozen or not able to receive/reflect payments for reasons not attributable to Payment Facilitator, Payment Facilitator's payment obligation under this Agreement shall be released as long as Payment Facilitator's records show the payment has been made.

2.11 **Payment Authorizations**. You authorize Payment Facilitator to collect from you amounts due pursuant to these Payment Terms and/or the Terms by either (i) charging the Payment Method associated with the relevant booking, or (ii) by withholding the amount from your future Pay-out. Specifically, you authorize Payment Facilitator to collect from you:

* Any amount due to Wink or Payment Facilitator (e.g., as a result of your bookings, booking modifications, cancellations, Accommodation Provider or Supplier), including reimbursement for costs prepaid by Wink or Payment Facilitator on your behalf.  
* Taxes, where applicable and as set out in the Terms.  
* Any service fees or cancellation fees imposed pursuant to the Terms (e.g., if, as an Accommodation Provider, you cancel a confirmed booking).  
* Any amounts already paid to you as an Accommodation Provider despite a Guest canceling a confirmed booking or Wink deciding that it is necessary to cancel a booking in accordance with the Terms, Guest Refund Policy, or other applicable cancellation policy. You agree that in the event you have already been paid, Payment Facilitator will be entitled to recover the amount of any such guest refund from you, including by subtracting such refund amount out from any future Pay-outs due to you.

2.12 **Collections**. If Payment Facilitator is unable to collect any amounts you owe under these Payment Terms, Payment Facilitator may engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you.

2.13 **Notifications**. Payment Facilitator will, upon request, send a notification of any outstanding balance due to the Accommodation Provider. Payment Facilitator will send these notices to the contact details that are held on file or communicated. It is the responsibility of the Affiliate to ensure these details are correct and up to date.

2.14 **Third Party Integrators**. Please note that certain affiliates, hereinafter referred to as "Third Party Integrators," will be responsible for handling payment transactions. As a result, these Third Party Integrators will assume the role of the merchant of record. Consequently, Wink's payment terms will no longer apply to these transactions. Instead, new payment terms specific to the Third Party Integrators must be accepted by the hotel.

**3\. Payment Processing Errors & Refunds**

3.1 **Errors**. Payment Facilitator will take the necessary steps to rectify any payment processing errors that we become aware of. These steps may include crediting or debiting (as appropriate) your Payment Facilitator account, so that you end up receiving or paying the correct amount. This may be performed by Payment Facilitator or a third party such as your financial institution. We may also take steps to recover funds sent to you in error (including but not limited to an event of duplicate payments made to you due to a processing error), by reducing, setting off and/or debiting the amount of such funds from any future Pay-outs owed to you. To the extent you receive any funds in error, you agree to immediately return such funds to Payment Facilitator.

3.2 **Refunds**. Any refunds or credits due to a Guest pursuant to the Terms and Guest Refund Policy will be initiated and remitted by Payment Facilitator in accordance with these Payment Terms.

3.3 Subject to this Section 3.2, Payment Facilitator will process refunds immediately. However, the timing to receive any refund will depend on the Payment Method and any applicable payment system (e.g., Visa, Mastercard) rules. In the event of a Force Majeure Event that may affect the processing and settlement of refunds, Payment Facilitator will initiate and process the refund as soon as is practicable.

**4\. Appointment of Payment Facilitator as Limited Payment Collection Agent**

4.1 Each Accommodation Provider, including each Accommodation Provider Team member, hereby appoints Payment Facilitator as the Accommodation Provider’s payment collection agent solely for the limited purpose of accepting and processing funds from Guests purchasing Accommodation Provider Services on the Accommodation Provider’s behalf.

4.2 Each Accommodation Provider, including each Accommodation Provider Team member, agrees that payment made by a Guest through Payment Facilitator shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Accommodation Provider, and the Accommodation Provider will provide the Accommodation Provider Service booked by the Guest in the agreed-upon manner as if the Accommodation Provider has received the payment directly from the Guest. Each Accommodation Provider agrees that Payment Facilitator may refund the Guest in accordance with the Terms. Each Accommodation Provider understands that Payment Facilitator’s obligation to pay the Accommodation Provider is subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the associated payments from the Guest. Payment Facilitator guarantees payments to Accommodation Provider(s) only for such amounts that have been successfully received by Payment Facilitator from Guests in accordance with these Payment Terms. In accepting the appointment as the limited payment collection agent of the Accommodation Provider, Payment Facilitator assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Accommodation Provider.

4.3 Each Guest acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding the fact that Payment Facilitator is not a party to the agreement between you and the Accommodation Provider(s), including each Accommodation Provider Team member, Payment Facilitator acts as each Accommodation Provider’s payment collection agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments on behalf of the Accommodation Provider(s). Upon a Guest’s payment of the funds to Payment Facilitator, the Guest’s payment obligation to the Accommodation Provider(s) for the agreed-upon amount is extinguished, and Payment Facilitator is responsible for remitting the funds successfully received by Payment Facilitator to the Accommodation Provider(s) in the manner described in these Payment Terms. In the event that Payment Facilitator does not remit any such amounts, the Accommodation Provider(s) will have recourse only against Payment Facilitator and not the Guest directly.

**5\. Prohibited Activities**

5.1 The Accommodation Provider is solely responsible for compliance with any and all laws, rules, regulations, and tax obligations that may apply to your use of the Payment Services. In connection with your use of the Payment Services, you may not and you agree that you will not and will not assist or enable others to:

* Breach or circumvent any applicable laws or regulations;  
* Breach or circumvent any agreements with third parties, third-party rights, or the Terms, Policies, or Standards;

* Avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, impair, descramble, or otherwise circumvent any technological measure implemented by Payment Facilitator to protect the Payment Services;  
* Take any action that damages or adversely affects, or could damage or adversely affect, the performance or proper functioning of the Payment Services;  
* Attempt to decipher, decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer any of the software used to provide the Payment Services; or  
* Violate or infringe anyone else’s rights or otherwise cause harm to anyone.

5.2 Payment Facilitator takes a zero-tolerance approach to breaches of international trade norms, bribery and corruption prevention legislation, and applicable restrictions on trade, funds flow, and terrorism financing.

The Accommodation Provider warrants that they do and shall comply with, and its Associated Parties do and shall comply with the Payment Facilitator Supplier Code of Conduct.

The Accommodation Provider represents, warrants, and undertakes that they do and will comply in all respects with all international trade norms, applicable restrictions on trade, funds flow, and terrorism financing and bribery and corruption prevention legislation, including, but not limited to the US American Anti-Corruption Act, UK Bribery Act 2010, and the Singapore Prevention of Corruption Act.
