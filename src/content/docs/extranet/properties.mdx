On this page, you will learn everything you need to know about how to create and manage properties on Wink.

## Create property

Once you are authenticated, you will be redirected to your [properties page](https://extranet.wink.travel/property/list) that shows you all your existing properties.
If you have a lot of them, you can filter your properties by typing in a name.

Click the `Create a new property` button to continue. You will be redirected to our [property creation](https://extranet.wink.travel/property/create) page.

There are three paths you can take to start onboarding your property.

1. ***Manual*** The handy-man's approach to `Do it all yourself!`
2. ***Claim*** Take ownership of a `lead` and claim it as your property.
3. ***Intelligent*** Leverage AI to automate some steps of the onboarding process.

### Manual

*Approx. time to complete: ~5 mins*

Our manual onboarding process lets you create a property with the minimum amount of fields to get started. 
Our easy-to-use wizard guides you through everything required to activate your profile and go live.

<Steps>
1. ***City*** Tell us where your property located *E.g. Estepona, Spain*.
2. ***Name*** The name of your property. *E.g. Santiva Resort*
3. ***Local name*** If your property is in a country that does not use the latin alphabet, type the local name of your property. *E.g. à¸‹à¸²à¸™à¸—à¸´à¸§à¸² à¸£à¸µà¸ªà¸­à¸£à¹Œà¸— in Thai*
4. ***Address*** Fill in the property address
5. ***Reservation desk*** Fill in reservation desk details.
6. ***Agreement*** Accept our [terms of service](/extranet/terms-of-service) and [payment terms](/extranet/payment-terms) to continue.
7. Click the `Save` button. 
</Steps>

You are redirected back to your properties page. 

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ ...you've created your first property on Wink the manual way.

### Claim

*Approx. time to complete: ~2 mins*

Other members can also [invite you](/studio/search#empty-results) to join Wink. You'll receive an email invite from us with a `lead` request you can claim and use to finalize property creation.

For those cases, you would:

<Steps>
1. Click on the Claim tab from the [properties page](https://extranet.wink.travel/property/list).
2. Click on the property you want to claim.
3. Continue the [intelligent](#intelligent) workflow.
</Steps>

You can also remove the claim and create your property from scratch, if you so choose.

### Intelligent

*Approx. time to complete: ~2 mins*

:::note
Your property needs to be available on Google Places to continue.
:::

Intelligent onboarding eliminates some of the steps that you would have to do manually. You get:

- Geo-location
- Address
- Images
- Auto-generated welcome text.
- ...and a few other things for free

Click the `Get Started` button for intelligent onboarding.

<Steps>
1. ***Name*** Start typing the name of your property as it is in Google. *E.g. Santiva Resort*.
2. ***Address*** Sometimes, we are unable to properly map a Google address and will ask for your help.
3. Click the `Save` button. 
</Steps>

You are redirected back to your properties page. 

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ ...you've created your first property on Wink the intelligent way.

## Dashboard

Once your property has been created, you can finalize your profile creation or start managing your property by clicking on the `Manage` link in your list of properties.
This takes you to the property dashboard.

The dashboard is home base for your property. It consists of sections to help you navigate and get the most out of our tools:

### How am I doing?

This section gives you a quick glance at the health of your property. It tells you:

- Total number of bookings
- Average booking value
- Total sales amount

These numbers include all bookings made from any sales channel on the Wink network.

### Sell your inventory

This section lets you know what type of tools are available to you when selling your inventory through Wink. 
Clicking on any of the boxes will take you to [Wink Studio](/studio/what-is-studio). 
Whether you're a hotel or affiliate, all selling happens there and hotels can be their own affiliates; selling through their own native sales channel. 

### Wink network requests

You can find pending requests from affiliates that want to connect with you in this section. 
There is also a link there that takes you directly to `Distribution > Explore network` so you can manage all your current and pending sales channels.

### Tasks

The tasks section shows you optional, but recommended, things you can do to make your property profile stand out more.

*We recommend adding your online reputation scores from any external site you have a rating on, such as up-to-date ratings from large OTAs.*

### Analytics

A new property automatically receives their own basics analytics at the time of creation. By default, you will see:

- Net revenue for the last 12 months.
- Average booking value for the last 12 months.
- Total page views for the last 12 months.
- Total bookings for the last 12 months.
- Total cancellations for the last 12 months.

These charts can easily be modified. However, these charts contain all the analytics your property will need for a while.

## Announcements

Announcements are a way to notify your guests of important information in a way that gets noticed.
If an announcment is `triggered`, it shows up as a new window above your landing page.

To see your announcements, click on `Property > Announcement` in the top navigation bar.

Click on `Create announcement` button to create a new entry.

<Steps>
1. Choose whether or not to include a title.
2. Announcements can be triggered in one of two ways:
    - Always display, every time someone visits your page.
    - Display only when the itinerary matches the announcement itinerary.
3. If you chose to only display announcement for a certain date range, add the dates in the form fields below.
4. Cilck the `Save` button and you will be taken back to your announcements.
</Steps>

## Property profile

The property profile is a required step in our onboarding wizard and gives us a chance to get to know your property better using criteria, such as: 

- Number of stars.
- Type of hotel.
- Location type.
- ...and more

To manage your property profile outside of the wizard, click on `Property > Profile` in the main navigation tab.

Update the form and click the `Save` button to continue.
