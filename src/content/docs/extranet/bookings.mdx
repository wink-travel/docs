3. Traveler receives a confirmation email that also includes how to get in touch with your reservation desk.
4. Developers can listen to the `booking.created` webhook event and receive detailed booking information from us in realtime.
</Steps>

Either follow the link in the email, or go to `Account > Bookings` from the main nav bar to get started.

## Calendar sync

To start synching your Wink bookings with you favorite calendar software, go to `Distribution > Sync bookings to your calendar` from the main nav bar to get started.

The first time, you will be asked to generate a pass code that you can use with your calendar software to authenticate the connection.

Click the `Yes` button to continue or 'No' if you changed your mind.

You will see 3 fields you need to use to connect Wink with your calendar software:

1. The URL to use to subscribe to bookings.
2. The username to authenticate with.
3. The pass key to authenticate with.

Once you've completed this step and added the CalDAV URL to your calendar software, your calendar will start displaying bookings from Wink.
