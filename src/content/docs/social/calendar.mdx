Publishing works like this:

<Steps>
1. Content is generated from your preferencesa week prior to the publishing month.
2. You receive an e-email telling you to approve the newly created content [or notify you that content has been created for the following month and that there is nothing else for you to do because you have chosen to auto-approve the content].
3. You log into [social.wink.travel](https://social.wink.travel) to approve the posts.
4. Posts are scheduled to be published. (You can still stop the publishing job if you do so before it is published. Otherwise, you will have to go to the social network and manually delete or modify the post there.)
5. Posts go out at the most opportune time for your selected time zone.
</Steps>

Once content is approved for publishing, it makes its way to your calendar.

:::note
There will be one entry for every language and every social network.

E.g. If you have 3 social networks and 3 languages selected, you will see 9 entries on the calendar.
