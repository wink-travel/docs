The post editor lets you create unlimited manual posts and it's also the place you go to manage posts that have been created for you automatically.

The editor has 4 sections:

1. The content section.
2. The media section.
3. The link section.
4. The settings section.

## Content

The content section allows you to modify the text content before it gets published.

## Media

The media sectio allows you to modify the images and videos that goes along with the text.

## Link

The link section allows you to link to somewhere you wish the user to go after she reads your post. *E.g. This can be a link to a special deal or a place to go to for more information.*

## Settings

The settings section lets you modify / override all your default settings. It can be helpful, when you maybe want the post to go out at a different time. Most of the time, this section won't be used.

## Approving posts

Posts are approved in the post grid where you can select one or more posts and choose to approve or reject a post.

:::note
There will be one entry for every language and every social network.

E.g. If you have 3 social networks and 3 languages selected, you will see 9 entries on the calendar.
