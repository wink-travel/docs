# Settings

When you first get started with Social, we will ask you to how you want us to create your content. These options are available to you at all times so you can easily change them later.

## Preferences

The first tab of Social settings contain your basic preferences. They are the following:

1. **Preferred customization** What customization do you want us to use when generating content. You create your customizations under your account on [my.wink.travel](https://my.wink.travel). Customizations control theme colors, default itinerary and much more and work in the context of our booking engine.
2. **Auto-approve** Trust us enough to publish new content every month without having to approve every post? Enable this switch and watch us do all the heavy lifting for you.
3. **Approver** However... if you do want to be notified of, and approve, newly created posts, enter in the contact details of the person in charge of that work.


## Content creators

Social comes with a many content creators to choose from.
A content creator focuses on one specific way of creating unique content for your property. Each content creator comes with a `weight` attribute. It is the chance factor of being chosen randomly.

### Example:

Hotel chooses Add-On and Property creators. Add-On creator gets a weight of 5 stars while Property creator gets a weight of 10 stars. The likelyhood of having Property content created is much higher than Add-On content.

## Personas

Text that we generate can use different `voices` / `personas` that more align with your brand. Choose the one[s] that fit you. As with content creators, you can set the likelyhood of the persona being used in content creation by increasing the **Weight**.

## Timezones

You might want to focus your marketing efforts on a particular language and region. Tell us the languages you want to create content for and the time zone you are interested in and we will do the rest.

*Most properties use a single language and default to their local language*

## Google Business

By adding your Google Business account, we can already extrapolate a lot of information that we can use as supplemental content. Some of our content creators **requires** that you have a Google Business account.

:::tip[Pro tip]
Start small

Don't be too ambitious on your first try. We recommend that you start by creating content for your property in a single language.
