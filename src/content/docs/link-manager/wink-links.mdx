A link manager lets you save and organize URLs you like for later. Your browser bookmarks is an example of a link manager. With the advent of social media, there came a greater need for exposing and making links available to your friends and audiences. Your Facebook feed is an example of a social-friendly link manager.

We built [WinkLinks](https://i.trvl.as/) to be the link manager for the travel industry. It's here to inform, excite, advertise... and lets you book great deals from hotels all over the world.

## Features

- WinkLinks lets you add all your existing affiliate links, like Commission Junction and Amazon, for free.
- You get a cool vanity url, such as [https://i.trvl.as/bob](https://i.trvl.as/bob), for those times when you can only share a single URL.
- You can organize and share links and upload files.
- Hotels, chains & brands can use WinkLinks as an advanced booking engine:
    - Supports multiple properties.
    - Supports multiple destinations.
    - Supports multiple currencies.
    - Supports multiple languages.
