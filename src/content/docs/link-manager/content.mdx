Your content is available under the `Entries` tab.

We support three main types of content:

- Publicly available URLs that link to web pages.
- Files that were uploaded through WinkLinks.
- Text content created through our `Quotes` feature.

## Add content

Here's how you add content to WinkLinks. Under the `Entries` tab, start by clicking the `Add entry` button.

### Normal link

:::tip
The link has to go to a web page. For example, you cannot link directly to a PDF. If you want to share a PDF, you need to use the `Upload file` feature.
:::

Here are the steps to add a normal link:

<Steps>
1. Enter the link you want to share. *e.g. https://trvl.as/s/3xWCH*
2. Once you enter the link, Wink goes out looking for the details of this website and populates the form you see next.
3. You can choose to modify some of the data, such as the site name, title and description.
4. You can also choose to upload a custom image.
5. Click the `Save` button when you are ready to continue.
</Steps>
