A link manager lets you save and organize URLs you like for later. Your browser bookmarks is an example of a link manager. With the advent of social media, there came a greater need for exposing and making links available to your friends and audiences. Your Facebook feed is an example of a social-friendly link manager.

:::caution
Most link managers require a subscription for anyone posting affiliate links. 
:::

We built [WinkLinks](https://i.trvl.as/); a completely <u>free</u> link manager, focused on the travel space, to excite, advertise and sell effectively online. 

## Features

- You can organize and share links and upload files.
- Hotels, chains & brands can use WinkLinks as an advanced booking engine:
    - Supports multiple properties.
    - Supports multiple destinations.
    - Supports multiple currencies.
