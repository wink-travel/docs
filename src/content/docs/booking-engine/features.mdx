This article covers the main features of the Wink booking engine.

## Customization

Hotels and affiliates can customize the `look and feel` of the booking engine by customizing the color palette. 

*Example: A traveler that comes from hotel-x.com will see the same brand colors as hotel-x.com.*

## Search

A traveler can also search for a destination or hotel directly or through our homepage where we we showcase the best hotels from different categories, like eco-friendly.

## Hotel landing page

Every property on Wink gets their own unique landing page on https://ota.wink.travel. All external links direct travelers to one of these landing pages.

*Example: https://ota.wink.travel/hotel/hotel-sensai-chiang-mai-thailand*

The landing page contains all the information a traveler needs to make an educated choice about whether to stay at this property.
