The booking engine comes in two varieties to support the different needs of an affiliate, a property management company and a hotel.

## Online travel agency

For an affiliate, it makes most sense to use the online travel agency version. The reason being the site is set up to accommodate travelers wanting to view multiple properties.

You can find the homepage for this application below.

</LinkButton>

## Internet booking engine

For a hotel or a property management company, it makes most sense to use the internet booking engine version. This type of user is interested in highlighting a single property or multiple properties under management.

You can find the homepage for this application below.

## Customization

Hotels and affiliates can customize the `look and feel` of the booking engine by customizing the color palette. 

Test customizing your theme in our developer sandbox below.

## Configuration

Most of the time, there is no need to share either of these applications directly. We have created a variety of ways for you to share travel inventory, which you can discover in [Wink Studio](/studio/what-is-studio).

However, if you wanted to manually link to one of these websites, make sure you add your client ID and customization ID to the URL as parameters. 

You can find your client ID by: 

<Steps>
1. Log into either [Wink Extranet](/extranet/what-is-extranet) or [Wink Studio](/studio/what-is-studio).
2. Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner and click on [Applications](/developers/applications).
3. Use the application that's tied to the Wink account you want to work with.
4. Copy the Client ID from that application and paste it on the URL as a request parameter. Example: ?client-id=MY_CLIENT_ID
</Steps>

### Extranet

You can find your customization ID as a property by: 

<Steps>
1. Log into [Wink Extranet](/extranet/what-is-extranet).
2. Select the property you want to work with. 
3. In the top navigation bar, click `Account > Branding`
4. Copy the Customization ID and paste it on the URL as a request parameter. Example: ?configuration-id=MY_CUSTOMIZATION_ID
</Steps>

### Studio

You can find your customization ID as an affiliate by: 

<Steps>
1. Log into [Wink Studio](/studio/what-is-studio).
2. Select the account you want to work with. 
3. In the top navigation bar, click `Tools > Customization`
4. Copy the Customization ID from the customization you want to use and paste it on the URL as a request parameter. Example: ?configuration-id=MY_CUSTOMIZATION_ID
</Steps>

## OTA

What you end up with is a URL that looks something like this:

https://ota.wink.travel?client-id=MY_CLIENT_ID&configuration-id=MY_CUSTOMIZATION_ID

If you wanted to go directly to a hotel page, the URL would look something like this:

https://ota.wink.travel/hotel/hotel-x?client-id=MY_CLIENT_ID&configuration-id=MY_CUSTOMIZATION_ID

:::note
If you don't include a client and / or configuration ID, Wink OTA will default to a default configuration.
:::

## IBE

If you are a property management company, you want to link to the Wink IBE homepage. The homepage will show your designated theme along with the [properties you represent](/studio/agency-representation).

What you end up with is a URL that looks something like this:

https://book.wink.travel?client-id=MY_CLIENT_ID&configuration-id=MY_CUSTOMIZATION_ID

If you are a property, you want to link directly to the Wink IBE property landing page.

That URL would look something like this:

https://book.wink.travel/hotel/hotel-x?client-id=MY_CLIENT_ID&configuration-id=MY_CUSTOMIZATION_ID


:::note
If you don't include a client and / or configuration ID, Wink IBE will NOT load. These parameters are required.
:::

## Example: Property page

Every property on Wink gets their own unique landing page in either website. All external links direct travelers to one of these landing pages.

The landing page contains all the information a traveler needs to make an educated choice about whether to stay at this property.
