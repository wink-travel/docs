Anywhere you see Wink inventory [cards](/studio/cards), you'll see a heart in the top-right corner of the card that lets you add that inventory to your bucket list.

Follow these steps to manage your bucket list:

<Steps>
1. Click on the ♡ `heart icon` for the inventory you want to add.
2. If you're logged in, the heart icon will turn red.
3. If you're not logged in, you'll be redirected to do so.
</Steps>

:::tip
Click the ♥️ `heart icon` a second time to remove it from your list.

You can manage all your bucket list items by clicking your profile icon in the top-right corner and then click the `Bucket list` button.
