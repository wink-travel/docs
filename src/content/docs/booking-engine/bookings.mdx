## Cancel a booking

:::caution
You can only cancel a booking that has a cancellation policy that allows for you to cancel the booking. Read the cancellation policy carefully before you book any room and choose a cancellation policy that works for you.
:::

If you want to cancel a booking, follow these steps:

<Steps>
1. Select the booking you want to cancel. You can do that by either:
    - Click on `Manage booking` link from the confirmation e-mail you received.
    - Go to manage bookings on https://ota.wink.travel and click the `Bookings` link that was mentioned in the previous section.
2. Click the `Cancel` button. *Cancel button is disabled if you can no longer cancel the booking.*
3. Tell us the reason for why you have to cancel and click `Submit`.
4. Based on the cancellation policy, the full or partial amount is refunded to you.
</Steps>

:::note
Expect approximately 1 - 3 days for a refund to go through.
:::

## Request a refund

Under certain circumstances, you can request a refund, after the cancellation policy expired. 

Please contact the hotel and explain the situation. The hotel will request the refund on your behalf.

## Write a review

Once the trip has come to an end [and you need a vacation from the vacation], we will e-mail you asking you please to write a review for the property you stayed at.

Here's how you write a review for the property:

<Steps>
1. Click the link in e-mail we sent you.
2. You might have to log back into Wink.
3. The link takes you to the booking confirmation page.
4. Click `Write review` button.
5. Complete the 5 multiple-choice questions.
6. Write a brief sentence(s) about your stay.
7. Click the `Submit` button.
</Steps>

Reviews are a great way for properties to get recognized that doesn't come with a price tag.

:::tip[Pro tip]
If your stay was not that great, don't spend all your time writing a negative review.

Instead, let the hotel know, while you are still on the premises, and you give the GM a chance to make it up to you.
