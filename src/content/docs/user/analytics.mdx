Knowledge is the lifeblood of Wink. It tells you how everyone, and everything, is performing on Wink, down to the hour. Before Wink, hotels would subscribe to a third party provider, and pay them a lot of money, to access, what the revenue management team refer to as, `the comp set`; which translates to: `How does my property compare with another property?`.

On Wink, you have access to platform-level analytics for free. This lets you track the performance of any affiliate, travel agent or property across any metric you want... as much as you want. You can also access broader trends by region to see what type of product is sold where and when. In the right hands, this insight can improve the selling skills of any Wink user.
