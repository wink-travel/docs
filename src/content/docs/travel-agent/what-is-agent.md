Our solution for registered travel agents is [Wink Agent](https://agent.wink.travel). It's a self-serve portal agents can use to search and book on behalf of their customers and earn a commission for themselves on each booking.

More advanced travel agents can choose to integrate at the API level for the purposes of handling payment and payouts outside the Wink platform.

Travel agents have a subset of the same portal features as [Wink Studio](/studio/what-is-studio) so we won't cover them again here.

## Search

Go to [Search](/studio/search) to learn how to search for and book hotels.

Otherwise, continue on to the next section.

## API

Developers who want to manage `Travel Agent` can head over to [Developers > API > Travel Agent](/developers/apis/#travel-agent-api).
