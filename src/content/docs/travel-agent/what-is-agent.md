Our solution for registered travel agents is [Wink Agent](https://agent.wink.travel). It's a self-serve portal agents can use to search and book on behalf of their customers and earn a commission for themselves on each booking.

More advanced travel agents can choose to integrate at the API level for the purposes of handling payment and payouts outside the Wink platform.

Travel agents have a subset of the same portal features as [Wink Studio](/studio/what-is-studio) so we won't cover them again here.

## Search

Go to [Search](/studio/search) to learn how to search for hotels to book.

## Direct relationships

Establish direct connections with properties to enjoy special deals for you and your customers. Go to [Network](/studio/network) to see how direct relationships work.

## Bookings

You can interact with your past and future bookings the same way as a property does. Go to [Bookings](/extranet/bookings) to learn how to manage bookings.

## API

Developers who want to manage `Travel Agent` can head over to [Developers > API > Travel Agent](/developers/apis/#travel-agent-api).
