:::note
This article assumes you already have a Wink user account.
:::

[Wink Agent](https://agent.wink.travel) connects you with travel inventory worldwide. This article steps you through creating and manging your travel agent accounts on Wink.

## Create account

Once you are authenticated, you will be redirected to your [accounts page](https://agent.wink.travel/company/list) that shows you all your travel agent accounts.

Click the `Create new account` button to continue. You will be redirected to our [account creation](https://agent.wink.travel/company/create) page. 

Fill in all required fields.

<Steps>
1. **Name** The name of your account. *This does not need to be your real name but will be something users see when looking at your WinkLinks page or when suppliers want to connect with you directly.*
2. **Entity type** Whether you are a company or individual. *Mostly used to determine how you are eligible to receive funds.*
3. **Type** Choose a type that applies best to your account. *e.g. Influencer* 
4. **Description** Write a description for your account. *This will be seen on your WinkLinks page and when suppliers want to connect with you directly.*
5. **Website** Enter your main website. *This can be your IG account URL or company website. It should be the place you do most of your online work. Suppliers will go to these links when they determine whether to connect with you.*
6. **City** Where are you based?
</Steps>

### Payment terms

:::note
If you choose to be responsible for payment, you will only have access to properties who you have a direct connection with.
:::

:::caution
Wink claims no responsibility for paying hotels in this scenario.
:::

:::note
You are only able to interact with this option during account creation. Most travel agents should leave this setting disabled ðŸ›‘ and use this portal instead.
:::

Registered travel agents who integrate with us, using our API, have the option to take payment and disburse those funds to our properties.

<Steps>
1. **I want to take payment** Travel agent takes responsibility for collecting funds.
2. **I want to pay hotels** Travel agent is responsible for paying hotels.
</Steps>

Hotels that want to connect directly with you will see a warning and have to click to acknowledge, that Wink is not responsible for paying hotels, in order to establish a relationship with your account.

Once created, you can customize your account further by filling in your address and adding a profile picture to your account. 

<Steps>
1. Click on your new travel agent account. *This will take you to your account dashboard.*
2. Click on `Account > Profile` in the top navigation bar.
3. On the Profile page, you will be able to update your existing profile and add additional information to it.
</Steps>

:::note
Your travel agent account profile picture should not be confused with your Wink user profile picture. Your travel agent account profile picture will be displayed on your WinkLinks page and seen by suppliers looking to connect with you. 

Your user profile picture is mostly for internal use.

## Managers

You can invite other users to help manage your travel agent account. Once a user accepts your invite, they will have full access to your account with the exception of payment. You will always be the only one in charge of the funds that you own.

<Steps>
1. Select the travel agent account you want to work with from the [accounts page](https://agent.wink.travel/company/list).
2. Click on `Account > Managers` in the top navigation bar.
3. Add the e-mail of the user you want to make into an account manager.
4. Click the `Invite` link next to the email.
</Steps>

Wink will send the user an email to accept or reject your invitation.

## Notifications

At times, we want to get in touch with you. When that happens, you will see the bell in the top right corner change. 
To read what we sent you:

<Steps>
1. Click on `Account > Notifications` in the top navigation bar.
2. You will see new and past notifications.
3. Choose to `Mark as read` or `Delete` the notifications once you've read them.
</Steps>

## API

Travel agents are still considered affiliates. Developers who want to manage `Affiliates` can head over to [Developers > API > Affiliate](/developers/apis/#affiliate-api).
