:::caution[Notice]
The payment terms below apply to travel agents that wish to acquire and disburse funds on their own.
This can only be done through our API and only by travel agents that have indicated that they want to do this during the sign-up process.

All travel agents are still able to book through our travel agent portal using Wink's payment gateway with their own or the traveler's credit card. Therefore, all travel agents also need to agree to the payment terms where Wink's payment gateway is the merchant of record.

Those terms are available under [Affiliate Portal > Payment Terms](/studio/payment-terms).

**WINK PAYMENT TERMS**   
**FOR TRAVEL AGENTS (Merchant of Record)**

These Payment Terms of Service (“Payment Terms”) are a binding legal agreement that forms part of the contractual relationship established under the "TERMS & CONDITIONS TRAVEL AGENTS" (“Main Agreement”)

2. **THE TRAVEL AGENT** whose details are set out in the Travel Agent Registration Form or have been submitted online (the "Travel Agent").

The definitions and terms established in the Main Agreement apply to these Payment Terms unless otherwise defined herein.

**1\. Definitions**

As defined in the main agreement "TERMS & CONDITIONS TRAVEL AGENTS" ("Main Agreement"), the following terms shall have the same meanings in these Payment Terms:

* "Accommodation Provider(s)"  
* "Booking"  
* "Booking Fee"  
* "Booking Value"  
* "Commission"  
* "Net Payment"

**2\. Payment Collection and Distribution**

2.1 **Payment Collection:** The Travel Agent is responsible for collecting payment from the Guest at the time of booking. This ensures immediate processing and financial clarity.

2.2 **Fee Deduction:** The Travel Agent shall deduct Service Provider’s fee first then deduct his commission for the subtitle as per example below:

* 1.5% Booking Fee for Wink.  
* The Travel Agent’s Commission as specified in the Separate Agreement (we shall use 10% for this example)

Booking Value USD 1,000  
Wink Fee (1.5%) \= USD 15  
Subtotal \= 1,000 \- 15 \= 985  
Travel Agent commission (i.e 10%) \= 985\*10% \= USD 98.5  
Net Payment to Hotel \= 985 \- 98.5 \= 886.5 

2.3 **Net Payment to Accommodation Providers:** The Travel Agent is responsible for disbursing the Net Payment to the Accommodation Provider according to the terms of the Separate Agreement between the Travel Agent and the Accommodation Provider. Wink is not liable for making any payments to the Accommodation Provider.
