When a booking is made on Wink, the following happens:

<Steps>
1. Your channel manager, CRS or PMS is notified.
2. You receive a confirmation email *(reservation desk contacts)* with a link to manage your new booking.
3. Traveler receives a confirmation email that also includes how to get in touch with your reservation desk.
4. The travel agent receives the same booking confirmation as the traveler.
4. Developers can listen to the `booking.created` webhook event and receive detailed booking information from us in realtime.
</Steps>

Either follow the link in the email, or go to `Account > Bookings` from the top navigation bar to get started.

## Booking grid

The booking grid shows you all your past and future bookings, sorted by book date in ascending order.

### Filters

You can apply filters to find the bookings you are looking for.

- Book date [range]
- Arrival date [range]
- Departure date [range]
- Booking code
- Last name of traveler
- First name of traveler
- Master rate name
- Property name

### Export

You can export bookings, that match your current filter criteria, to CSV. 

To export your bookings: 

<Steps>
1. Make sure your desired filters are active.
2. Wait for the booking grid to refresh.
2. Click the üóÇÔ∏è (*File export*) icon button in the bottom-right corner of the grid.
</Steps>

## Booking

Select the booking you want to work with from the booking grid and you will be redirected to the `Booking` page. 
This page contains all the details you need to know to properly welcome your guest on the day of arrival.

The page also contains a few important actions you need to properly service your guests. You can find all available actions in the `Actions` dropdown at the top of the page.

### Resend e-mail

To resend the confirmation email to the traveler, click `Actions > Resend confirmation email`.

### Cancel booking

2. Type a reason for the cancellation. 
</Steps>

*This button follows your cancellation policy rules and will therefore not always be available.*
