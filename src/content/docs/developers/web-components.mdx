[Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) is a standard that lets you integrate entire Javascript features into your website without knowing how to code.
Thanks to this cool technology, it lets you embed Wink travel inventory with very little fuss. This article steps you through our collection of web components and shows you how to use them.

## Embed Wink

There are three things you have to include into any page where you want to display one of our web components.

1. Include our stylesheet.
2. Include our Javascript.
3. Include our application loader.

### Stylesheet

Include our CSS styles in the head of your document.

```html {3}
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://elements.wink.travel/styles.css"></link>
  </head>
</html>
```

### Javascript

Include our Javascript at the bottom of your document. (*We recommend immediately above the end &lt;/body&gt; tag*).

```html {3}
<html>
  <body>
    <script src="https://elements.wink.travel/elements.js" type="module" defer></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Your site is now ready and able to display our web components.

## Components

Read about our component library below.

### Application loader

The loader is responsible for keeping state and managing interaction between our components. (*Include it below our Javascript*).

```html {3-6}
<html>
  <body>
    <wink-app-loader
      client-id="YOUR CLIENT ID GOES HERE"
      configuration-id="YOUR CUSTOMIZATION ID GOES HERE"
    ></wink-app-loader>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Content loader

The content loader is at the heart of our web component library. It's responsible for displaying your inventory (cards, grids, maps).

Available attributes:

- layout
- id
- sort

*The attribute `sort` is only available when layout is `RANKED` and you don't want to use an existing ranked grid. For these cases, leave `id` empty.*

Available layout types:

- `AD_BANNER`
- `MAP`
- `HOTEL`
- `GUEST_ROOM`
- `MEETING_ROOM`
- `SPA`
- `RESTAURANT`
- `ACTIVITY`
- `ATTRACTION`
- `PLACE`
- `ADD_ON`
- `LIST`
- `SEARCH`
- `RANKED`

Available sort types:

- `MEMBER`
- `PRICE_LOW_TO_HIGH`
- `PRICE_HIGH_TO_LOW`
- `PRICE`
- `POPULARITY`
- `ECO`
- `EXPERIENCE`
- `PERK`
- `LOYALTY`
- `PACKAGE`

```html {3-6}
<html>
  <body>
    <wink-content-loader
       layout="GUEST_ROOM"
       id="2de7ee9c-61c9-11ef-9722-42004e494300"
    ></wink-content-loader>
  </body>
</html>
```

Samples can be found for [cards](/studio/cards), [grids](/studio/grids) and [maps](/studio/maps).

### Lookup

Lookup works great together with one of your ranked grids. It lets your users search for hotel and destination and the grid updates in response to their search result.

```html {3}
<html>
  <body>
    <wink-lookup></wink-lookup>
  </body>

### Itinerary form

The itinerary component displays an itinerary form users can interact with.

```html {3}

  <body>
    <wink-itinerary-form></wink-itinerary-form>
  </body>

```

      src="academy/itinerary-form"
      errorImage="noimage_opaque_nyrtl0.png"
    />
    <figcaption>*Itinerary form web component*</figcaption>

By changing the itinerary, in any of our itinerary component, triggers the itinerary update event to any inventory you currently have displaying on the page.

### Account

The account button allows you to add Wink authentication to your site.

## Embed TripPay

There are two things you have to include into any page where you want to use the TripPay payment web component.

1. Include our stylesheet.
2. Include our Javascript.

### Stylesheet

Include our CSS styles in the head of your document.

```html {3}
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://elements.trippay.io/styles.css"></link>
  </head>
</html>
```

### Javascript

Include our Javascript at the bottom of your document. (*We recommend immediately above the end &lt;body&gt; tag*).

```html {3}
<html>
  <body>
    <script src="https://elements.trippay.io/elements.js" type="module" defer></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Your site is now ready and able to display our web components.

## Components

### Payment

The payment component lets you inform TripPay that a traveler wants to purchase something and the rules and prices for those items.

There is one required attribute to the widget:

- `id` The identifier of the booking contract you want executed.

```html {3}
<html>
  <body>
    <trip-pay id="<INSERT_BOOKING_CONTRACT_ID>"></trip-pay>
  </body>
</html>
```

:::note
To learn how to generate the booking contract `id`, read the guide: [Integrating with TripPay](/guides/integrating-with-trip-pay).
:::

The widget prepares the contract for execution and displays payment details *(Figure 1)* to the user to finalize the booking.

## Errors

If you are greeted with an error message when embedding one of our web components, either on WinkLinks or on your own web site, there are a few things that might have gone wrong:

### Availability

Inventory might no longer be available. Go to [Wink Studio](/studio/cards) and check to see if the status of the "card" is available.
If it is not, it will show up as red. If that's the case, you can wait and maybe the supplier makes it available again or remove it from your list.

:::note
`Availability` does not mean the daily availability of the inventory to be booked. It means that the inventory is completely unavailable to you and/or anyone.
:::

### Removed

Inventory might have been removed. Go to [Wink Studio](/studio/cards) and check to see if the status of the "card" is available.
If it is not, it will show up as red. If that's the case, you can wait and maybe the supplier makes it available again or remove it from your list.

### Customization

You might have accidentally removed the customization you have defined to go along with your inventory. Make sure the customization is still available and set a new one if one is missing.

### Application

This is for web developers only. If you accidentally removed the [Application](/developer/applications) ; making the client ID no longer available, please create a new application and use the new client ID to embed our Web Components.
