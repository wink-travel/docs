This article shows you how to quickly get set up as a developer and start testing our APIs on Wink.

:::note
Testing should always occur in our [staging environment](/getting-started/environments). There is a lot less data there but you are free to test as much as you want without imposing on the production environment.

Once you are ready to go live, we will certify your account and your application and you can launch in our production environment.
:::

Follow these steps:

<Steps>
1. [Register](/user/register) your user account on Wink
2. Create a [travel agent account](/travel-agent/what-is-agent) or an [affiliate account](/studio/what-is-studio).
3. [Create an Application](/developer/applications) where you associate it with the account you created in Step 2.
4. Once you've created your `Application`, save the client-id and client secret in a safe place.
</Steps>

## CDN

At Wink, we use Cloudinary for all our image and video assets. When you access our travel inventory, you will have full access to all of Cloudinary's advanced features.

Our `cloud_name` is  `traveliko`.

### Cloudinary

- [Getting started](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/dev_kickstart)
- [SDKs](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/cloudinary_sdks)
- [Cloudinary on GitHub](https://github.com/cloudinary)
-	[Video Tutorials](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/cloudinary_sdks_tutorials)

### Example

For every travel inventory type we support, there will be a nested JSON array called `multimedias`. The JSON for a multimedia entry looks like this:

```json {3}
{
  "multimediaIdentifier": "multimedia-1",
  "identifier": "partners/radisson_blu_logo",
  "type": "IMAGE",
  "width": "1024",
  "height": "768",
  "category": "1",
  "descriptions": [
    {
      "name": "Lobby",
      "description": "Picture of the lobby",
      "language": "en"
    }
  ],
  "lifestyleType": "LIFESTYLE_BUSINESS",
  "attribution": [
    {
      "url": "https://www.hilton.com",
      "name": "Hilton"
    }
  ]
}
```

The highlighted line above shows the Cloudinary unique ID `partners/radisson_blu_logo`. That is all you need to retrieve the image in any format, quality and size you want.

## Testing

Head on over to our [APIs](/developer/apis) section and choose the API you want to work with.

### API docs

Our documentation site is set up in such a way that you can run API commands from within the site.

In this example, you want to use the `Search Lookups (OAuth2)` API call.

:::tip[Pro Tip]
For ease of use, we recommend that integrators use the endpoints we designate as `OAuth2`. Those endpoints know to expect API callers and already knows which account you're on so you don't have to speciy the `companyIdentifier` in your URLs.
:::

<Steps>
1. Use the [Lookup API](https://docs.wink.travel/lookup) to retrieve destinations or hotels.
2. In the left navbar, click on `Authentication`.
3. Enter your client-id and client secret and click the `Get TOKEN` button.
4. If your credentials are valid, you will see that your API key has been applied.
5. You can now test the lookup endpoint.
</Steps>

      errorImage="noimage_opaque_nyrtl0.png"
    />

</figure>

### Postman
You can do the same thing with Postman.

<Steps>
1. Download [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads).
2. Click on `Download OpenAPI spec` from the top of the [Lookup API](https://docs.wink.travel/lookup) page.
3. Import it into Postman.
4. If you imported it as a new collection called `Wink API`, click on the horizontal elipsis (3 dots) next to the collection name and click `Edit`.
5. In the `Authorization tab`, set the `Auth type` to OAuth2.
6. Set the field `Add auth data to` to `Request headers`.
7. Set the field `Header prefix` to `Bearer`.
8. Set the field `Token Name` to whatever you want to name your saved token in Postman. E.g. Wink Staging.
9. Set the field `Grant type` to `Client Credentials`.
10. Set the field `Access token URL` to https://staging-iam.wink.travel/oauth2/token.
11. Set the field `Client ID` to the Client ID your app helped generate.
12. Set the field `Client Secret` to the Client Secret your app helped generate.
13. Set the field `Scope` to `inventory.read inventory.write inventory.remove`. Those are all the scopes you will need for Wink.
14. Set the field `Client Authentication` to `Send as Basic Auth header`.
15. Click the `Get New Access Token` button to retrieve your token and save it.
16. For all API calls under the Wink API collection, make sure the authentication tab says `Inherit auth from parent` so it includes your token with every call.
</Steps>

:::tip[Pro Tip]
It is recommended to make the server domain, client ID and client secret into environment variables. That way you can easily switch between staging and production environments and re-use all the operations you've created.
