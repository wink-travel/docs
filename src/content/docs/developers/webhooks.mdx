Webhooks are a way for you to receive, and react to, realtime events from Wink and TripPay concerning your account.

## Example

<Steps>
1. A booking occurs on Wink.
1. The Wink event `booking.created` is dispatched.
2. Your system is actively listening to this event.
3. Your system tracks your own set of analytics and uses this event to update its time-series database.
</Steps>

:::note
A Wink webhook is different from a TripPay webhook.

- If you want to listen to Wink events, you can create a webhook from [Extranet](https://extranet.wink.travel) or [Studio](https://studio.wink.travel).
- If you want to listen to TripPay events, you can create a webhook from [Payment](https://pay.wink.travel).
:::

*For this example, we will authenticate via [Studio](https://studio.wink.travel).*

<Steps>
1. Once authenticated, click your profile icon, in the top-right corner, and a menu will appear.
2. Click the `Webhooks` link.
3. You will be redirected to your webhooks page.
</Steps>

## Create webhook

:::caution
You need to create an affiliate account on Wink or an account on TripPay before you create a webhook as you will be binding your webhook to a specific account.
:::

Here are the steps to creating an webhook:

<Steps>
1. From the webhooks page, click the `Create new webhook` button.
2. ***Name*** Give your webhook a name. *e.g. Wink Stalker*
3. ***Enable*** Leave as-is to be enabled.
4. **Entity name** Link your webhook with one of your existing accounts. *e.g. Cool Account*
5. **Events** Listen to the events that interest you. *e.g. `booking.created`*
6. **Webhook URL** Enter the URL where you will be listening to events from us. *e.g. `https://my.system.com/webhook/wink`*
7. Click the `Save` button to continue.
</Steps>

You are redirected back to your list of webhooks and your new webhook is ready to go.
