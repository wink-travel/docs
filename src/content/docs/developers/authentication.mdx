:::tip
The Wink IAM authentication server supports the common OAuth2 endpoints:

- /oauth2/authorize
- /oauth2/token
- /oauth2/introspect
- /oauth2/revoke
- /oauth2/userinfo
:::

An application provides your with a `Client ID` and `Secret Key` that you need to create an authenticated OAuth2 session you can use to communicate with Wink and TripPay APIs.

Here are the steps to create an authenticated session.

**Step 1**. Retrieve an access token on staging or in our production environment:

You will, most likely, be working with a robust OAuth2 library for your language, which will do all the heavy lifting for you.
Our examples will show the most basic usage from the command line using `curl`.

### Staging

```bash

curl -X POST https://staging-iam.wink.travel/oauth2/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
  -d "client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>" \
  -d "client_secret=<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>"

```

### Production

```bash

curl -X POST https://iam.wink.travel/oauth2/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
  -d "client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>" \
  -d "client_secret=<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>"

```

This will return an access token, along with other OAuth2 response data:

```json
{
  "access_token": "abc123"
}
```

When you make a call to any of our endpoints, include the following in the header:

- `Wink-Version` = `2.0` Latest - *See our API docs for other available versions.*
- `Authentication` = `Bearer: ${access_token}` *Insert your access token.*

:::tip
You can test all our APIs without writing a single line of code before getting started.

Grab a 'Client ID' and 'Secret Key' from one of your apps and navigate to any of our [APIs](/developers/apis).
