Applications give you full access to features on Wink and TripPay and lets your users authenticate and log into your site using our OAuth2 authorization server; just like Facebook and Google. 
You can build your own OTA with Wink. It starts with an application.

*By default, you get an app when you register a new Wink affiliate account or TripPay account. We use the `client ID` for some scenarios.*

:::note
An application generated on Wink or TripPay can be used for all API endpoints.
:::

*For this example, we will authenticate via [Wink Studio](https://studio.wink.travel).*

<Steps>
1. Once authenticated, click your profile icon, in the top-right corner, and a menu will appear.
2. Click the `Applications` link.
3. You will be redirected to your apps page.
</Steps>

## Create app

As you cannot access the `secret key` of the app we created for you, you will need to create your own.

:::caution
You need to create an affiliate account on Wink or an account on TripPay before you create an app as you will be binding your application to a specific account.
:::

Here are the steps to creating an application:

<Steps>
1. From the apps page, click the `Create new application` button.
2. ****Name**** Give your app a name. *e.g. Cool App*
3. ***Entity name*** Link your app with one of your existing accounts. *e.g. Cool Account*
4. ***Redirect URIs*** At least one redirect URI is required. It is used for validating the redirect domain after a successful authentication. *e.g. https://www.cool-site.com*
5. Click the `Save` button to continue.
</Steps>

You are redirected back to your list of applications. You will see your new app in the list and have access to the app secret key only this once. Make sure to copy it and save it in a safe place.

## Update app

You will need to update your app if one of your redirect URIs change or you want to add or remove a URI.

To update an existing app, do the following:

<Steps>
1. Click the `Actions` link for the app you want to update.
2. Click the `Update` button under Actions.
3. Make your changes to the app.
4. Click the `Save` button to continue.
</Steps>

You are redirected back to your list of applications.

## Remove app

:::caution
Please dont' delete the app we auto-created for you to make sure all the features work for you account.
:::

If you have no further use for an app, you can go ahead and remove it.

To remove an app, do the following:

<Steps>
1. Click the `Actions` link for the app you want to update.
2. Click the `Remove` button under Actions.
3. Click `OK` button to confirm deletion.
</Steps>

You are redirected back to your list of applications.
