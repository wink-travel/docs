A platform like this is not built in isolation. Rather, it's the sum of many moving parts; old and new. We want to continue to serve others who come after us.

Travel tech is fragmented and legacy. We have tried to take the best of the old that works. We've integrated a bunch of channel managers, property management systems ++. We've added some new stuff. And, we've wrapped it all in industry standards and protocols that are known and easily consumable... so you don't have to.

:::note[API-driven approach]
Roughly means, whatever features we build for ourselves should be:
 
- Understandable
- Flexible
- Scalable
- Reusable and...
- Extendable 

...by others who also want to use these APIs.
:::

Wink was built using such an `API-driven approach`. As a result of this design philosophy, all of Wink's features can be interacted with as an external developer as if the system was your own. There are also other aspects to the platform that you can leverage when integrating with us. 

## Channel manager

We have dedicated channel manager endpoints for Property Management Systems, Channel managers and Central Reservation Systems wishing to send us property rates and availability.

## APIs

:::note
See [Application Programming Interfaces](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/)
:::

Use our REST (Representatinal State Transfer) APIs for a `bare metal` integration, exactly the way you want it.
