By clicking `Yes`, you create a new sales channel for Google, at 0% commission and using the same membership discount that you applied to Wink Network. 

:::note
Give Google some time to grab your rates and data. This process is not immediate. Your property should be up and running within a 24 hour period or sooner.
:::

That's it! That's all you need to do get your property listed on Google Maps etc with Wink. When a Google Maps user clicks on your link, she will be taken to your booking engine landing page on Wink to finalize the booking.

:::tip[Pro Tip]
This is a free listing and there is never a need, nor can you, get better placement on Google by increasing the amount of commission on this sales channel. 

Keep in mind, Wink holds your `official site` badge. Please make sure to disable any other rate provider you use to get on Google, that also has the official site badge, to avoid confusion.
