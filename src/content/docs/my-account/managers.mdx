## Invite user

You can invite other users to help manage your affiliate account. Once a user accepts your invite, they will have full access to your account with the exception of payment. You will always be the only one in charge of the funds that you own.

<Steps>
1. Select the account you want to work with from [Accounts](https://my.wink.travel).
2. Click on `Actions` from the bottom of the account card and choose to `Manage account`.
3. Click the `Managers` tab on the following page.
4. Enter the e-mail of the person you would like to invite to manage your account.
5. Click the `Invite` link next to the email.
</Steps>

Wink will send the user you want to add to your account an email and that person can choose to accept or reject your invitation.
