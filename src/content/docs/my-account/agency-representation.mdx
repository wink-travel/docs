An agency is a normal Wink account you, as an owner, can assign to your account for the purposes of representation. Below are some reasons why you would want an agency representing you:

- Full / Partial management of your Wink account by a 3rd party.
- Property has an existing agreement with their management company and wants Wink to handle the financial aspect of their arrangement of funds coming in through Wink.
- Property management agency does all online work on behalf of its properties.
- Talent agency representing an influencer / content creator.
