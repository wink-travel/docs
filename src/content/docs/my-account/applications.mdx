Applications give you access to all of Wink's features as a developer. You can access all the same data and even extend Wink's own features.
You can choose to use Wink's OAuth2 server to authenticate your travel site the same way you would use Google or Facebook.
That way you can extend Wink's features into your own website or application.

:::note
Your first app is already created when you [create a new account](/my-account/create-account). We use the the app for some booking scenarios.

You cannot re-use this app. Please create new apps as you need them.

:::note
An application generated on Wink can be used for all API endpoints.
:::

<Steps>
 1. Select the account you want to work with from [Accounts](https://my.wink.travel).
 2. Click on `Actions` from the bottom of the account card and choose to `Manage account`.
 3. Click the `Applications` tab on the following page.
 4. This section will list all your applications.
 5. Choose to edit an existing one or create a new one.
 </Steps>

## Create app

As you cannot access the `secret key` of the app we created for you, you will need to create your own.

:::caution
You need to create an affiliate account on Wink or an account on TripPay before you create an app as you will be binding your application to a specific account.
:::

Here are the steps to creating an application:

<Steps>
1. From the apps page, click the `Create new application` button.
2. ***Name*** Give your app a name. *e.g. Cool App*
3. **Entity name** Link your app with one of your existing accounts. *e.g. Cool Account*
4. **Redirect URIs** At least one redirect URI is required. It is used for validating the redirect domain after a successful authentication. *e.g. https://www.cool-site.com*
5. Click the `Save` button to continue.
</Steps>

You are redirected back to your list of applications. You will see your new app in the list and have access to the app secret key only this once. Make sure to copy it and save it in a safe place.

## Update app

You will need to update your app if one of your redirect URIs change or you want to add or remove a URI.

To update an existing app, do the following:

<Steps>
1. Click the `Actions` link for the app you want to update.
2. Click the `Update` button under Actions.
3. Make your changes to the app.
4. Click the `Save` button to continue.
</Steps>

You are redirected back to your list of applications.

## Remove app

:::caution
Please dont' delete the app we auto-created for you to make sure all the features work for you account.
:::

If you have no further use for an app, you can go ahead and remove it.

To remove an app, do the following:

<Steps>
1. Click the `Actions` link for the app you want to update.
2. Click the `Remove` button under Actions.
3. Click `OK` button to confirm deletion.
</Steps>

You are redirected back to your list of applications.
