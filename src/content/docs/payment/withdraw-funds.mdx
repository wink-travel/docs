Unless you are an integrator, you don't have to worry about creating an account on TripPay. The integrator will do that for you at the time you create an account with them.

Payees use TripPay to:

- Track how much money they've made.
- How much is currently in their account.
- ...and what amount is available to withdraw. 

## Usage

A normal payee usually interacts with TripPay like this:

<Steps>
1. TripPay retains funds from 10 bookings, from 3 different travel platforms, for Hotel X and the funds are now available.
2. Hotel X receives an e-mail from TripPay saying `You have funds available` and with a link to manage their account.
3. Hotel X logs into [TripPay](https://pay.wink.travel).
4. Hotel X sees last month's bookings along with account analytics.
5. Hotel X selects to withdraw funds.
6. Hotel X chooses the `Pay-out` method.
7. Hotel X follow the steps required to process the funds.
8. Hotel X submits transfer request and clicks `OK`.
</Steps>

*Funds are typically available within 24 hours in all regions.*
