If you are an integrator, like Wink, and want to map your external payees for use with TripPay, you can do it one out of two ways:

- Manual mapping
- Using the [Payment API](/developers/apis/#payment-api) (*See `Account Mappings`*)

Unless you are only dealing with a handful of the same properties, we recommend that you use the API to automate this step.

Below, we step you through the manual way of mapping an external payee. *It uses the API under-the-hood.*

<Steps>
1. Log into [TripPay](https://pay.wink.travel).
2. Select your integrator account.
3. Click `Settings > Mappings` from the top navigation bar.
4. Click the `Create mapping` button. You will see the mapping form.
5. **Local account** Start typing the name of the existing TripPay you want to map.
6. **External identifier** Paste your external ID for this entity as it exists in the remote system.
7. Click `Save` to continue. You are redirected back to your list of mappings.
</Steps>

With your mappings in place, TripPay now knows which accounts to credit as beneficiaries of a booking when you refer to them using your external identifiers. 

## API

Developers who want to manage `Payments`, go to [Developers > API > Payments](/developers/apis/#payment-api).
