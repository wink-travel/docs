If you are a travel company and you want to outsource the payment and disbursement part of your business to TripPay, here are 6 basic steps to get started:

<Steps>
1. Create a [user account](/user/register) on Wink.
2. Create an account with [TripPay](https://pay.wink.travel).
3. Create an [Application](/developers/applications) on TripPay that lets you talk to our API.
4. Create and map your beneficiaries with TripPay. *e.g. For most, that means creating accounts for the properties on your platform that you want TripPay to pay.*
5. Integrate the [payment web component](/developers/web-components#payment) into your site.
6. Send TripPay the traveler's `shopping cart` and initiate the payment process.
</Steps>
