:::note
Wink acquired TripPay in 2019 after using TripPay's services.

[TripPay](https://pay.wink.travel) is a technology company that was created to solve the issues and requirements related to managing the pay-ins and pay-outs of multiple parties in the travel industry. 

By far the biggest feature TripPay offers to integrators and suppliers is massive savings through the consolidation of payouts from multiple sales channels and the outsourcing of many back-office accounting tasks.

## Scenario

All small to mid-tier OTAs and travel agents, that currently acquire funds from travelers, start using TripPay.

Here is what the workflow looks like:

<Steps>
1. Funds from all travel-related bookings flow into TripPay.
2. TripPay manages cancellations and refunds.
3. Funds become available based on rules set by the integrator.
4. Funds are consolidated for every supplier on TripPay.
5. Payouts occurs when the payees want it to happen.
</Steps>

As a result, travel companies are freed up to focus on selling while TripPay handles all back-office tasks and can focus on offering the best payment methods, the best disbursement methods and receive volume discounts no single travel company could do by themselves.
