:::tip
Wink acquired TripPay in 2019 after being the first company to fully integrate with TripPay's features.
:::

[TripPay](https://pay.wink.travel) is a technology company that was created to solve the issues and requirements related to managing the pay-ins and pay-outs of multiple parties in the travel industry. 

## Features

Most of TripPay's main features occur `under the hood`. Those include:

- Managing companies and offices, with travel agent licenses, in multiple regions.
- Offer multiple [and local] cheap, payment options for travelers.
- Offer multiple, fast, cost-effective, disbursement options for payees: 
    - Suppliers
    - Affiliates
    - Facilitiators
- Automating the disbursement of funds.
- Managing KYC (Know Your Customer) for all payor & payees. 
- Supports 8500 variations of cancellation policy rules.
- Supports manual refund requests.

Features our customers can directly interact with:

- Embeddable payment widget you can include in your site to capture payment.
- Manage accounts.
- Manage mappings (link your internal payees with TripPay accounts).

## Payees

Unless you are an integrator, you don't have to worry about creating an account on TripPay. The integrator will do that for you at the time you create an account with them. 

*Because Wink and TripPay is the same company, you can use your account on Wink to log into TripPay as well.*

Payees log into TripPay to track how much money they made on each booking, how much is in their account and what can be withdrawn. 
A normal payee usually interacts with TripPay in this fashion:

<Steps>
1. You receive an e-mail from TripPay telling you that you have funds in your account with a link to manage your account.
2. Your log into [TripPay](https://pay.wink.travel).
3. You browse your bookings and view account analytics.
4. Find out the amount that is currently available to withdraw.
5. Select to withdraw funds.
6. Choose `Pay-out` method.
7. Follow the steps required to pay out your funds.
8. Click `OK`.
</Steps>

*Funds are typically available in 24 hours.*

:::note
Once you reach a certain volume and amount, we may reach out to you for more documentation that verifies your identity and / or that of your company.

## Integrate

If you are a travel company that wishes to outsource the payment and disbursement part of your business to TripPay, here are 3 steps to follow:

<Steps>
1. Create a [user account](/user/register) on Wink.
2. Create an account with [TripPay](https://pay.wink.travel).
3. Create an [Application](/developers/applications) on TripPay that lets you talk to our API.
4. Create and map your beneficiaries with TripPay. *e.g. For most, that means creating accounts for the properties on your platform that you want TripPay to pay.*
5. Integrate the [payment web component](/developers/web-components#payment) into your site.
6. Learn how to prepare travel inventory and make it available for purchase using the [TripPay API](/developers/apis/payment-api).
