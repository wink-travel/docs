## A virtual sales & marketing team

Social media is one of the most powerful marketing tools for hotels, yet most properties lack the time, expertise, or resources to consistently post high-quality, engaging content that converts.
We solve this problem by using AI-powered automation to generate and post dynamic, real-time content without manual effort from hotels.

- AI-driven social media content tailored to each hotel's offerings.
- Pulls from real-time inventory, promotions, and user-uploaded content.
- Full approval process ensures hotels maintain brand control.
- Zero manual effort required while maximizing direct bookings.

This feature transforms how hotels engage with travelers, helping them maintain a consistent, optimized, and revenue-driven social media presence at scale.

Unlike generic AI social media tools, our system is built specifically for hotels, integrating directly with real-time inventory, rates, and our hotel content.

## How it works

With our advanced content management platform for properties, of all shapes and sizes, it was a natural evolution to incorporate AI into the mix and wrap it in a scheduling mechanism that can push content anywhere where the hotel is.

The social media automation engine leverages AI and all of Wink's free features such as shareable links, accessing real-time inventory, and hotel-provided content to create highly optimized posts tailored for direct conversions.

1. AI scans content from Wink's CDN.
2. AI creates social media posts.
3. Content is sent to hotel for approval.
4. Posts are translated to languages of choice.
5. Posts are scheduled to go out to selected social networks.

### Content sources

AI will generate social media posts dynamically using:

- Hotel Extranet Data: Room descriptions, images, amenities, and pricing.
- Real-Time Inventory: Available rooms, limited-time promotions, and flash deals.
- User-Uploaded Content: Custom images, videos, and text.
- Publicly available hotel content.

### AI generated posts

Posts are generated by:

1. Running sentiment analysis on available content.
2. Leveraging existing images.
3. Producing enhanced captions, text and hashtags with pre-defined personas.
4. Creates image previews with real-time pricing overlays.

#### Examples

- "Book early and save! üí∞" (transactional)
- "Book a fishing üêü trip along with your room!" (transactional)
- "9 of 10 travelers üíï this hotel" (sentiment)
- "Best place I've been to in ages. üí• --Dr. Shu" (sentiment)
- "Only 200m from Disneyland üí¶" (informational)
- "Be at the airport üõ´ in 10 mins" (informational)

### Approval process

The hotel always remains in control while benefiting from hands-free automation. It can always choose a "set-and-forget" policy and let us automate everything.

However, before trusting us with managing your social channels completely, you can ask to be notified and approve each post that is scheduled to go out next month.

You'll be able to:

- Approve: Choose languages to translate post to and social networks to distribute to.
- Revise: Let AI generate an alternative version and manually make changes.
- Reject: The post is discarded.

### Scheduler

We use AI to auto-schedule your posts to go out at peak engagement times for better reach and engagement.

## Tracking & Optimization

- Wink tracks clicks, conversions, and engagement in real-time.
- High-performing posts are recycled and repurposed for better reach.
- AI learns from past performance and adapts future posts accordingly.

## Automated DMs & Replies

Our Automated DMs & Replies feature helps your hotel efficiently manage guest interactions by handling all comments and direct messages on your social media channels. Using AI, it responds quickly and accurately to inquiries about on-site amenities or nearby attractions, and can provide trackable booking links, making it easier to convert conversations into reservations without added effort.

### Example

1. User replies to a social post saying "Beautiful!!! Wish I was there üòä"
2. An automated reply could be "Nice right!! Sunsets in April are truly stunning here. You know... you'd save 30% if you book early. Check it out https://trvl.as/AB76g"

## AI Concierge

The AI Concierge uses the same technology as our Automated replies & DMs to provide a custom chatbot for your hotel's website. This tool interacts with potential guests in real-time, answering their questions, providing personalized recommendations, and helping them complete a booking, making it simpler to convert website visitors into guests.

### Example

**User** "Hi... I have a question."

**Bot** "Hi yourself! How can I help you?"

**User** "I am wondering when the best time to visit is?"

**Bot** "Great question. We have the most guests in December / January. That's what we consider peak season. If you can visit in February, the weather is still the same but the prices are lower and there are less people."

**User** "Do you have a promo code for February?"

**Bot** "No, we don't... but if you book 30 days in advance you get an extra 15% off the lower price on our twin rooms."

**Bot** "Here's a picture of the room [Image]"

**User** "I want that!"

**Bot** "Awesome, here's a link you can use https://trvl.as/AB76g"

**Bot** "Anything else I can help you with?"

## Subscription tiers

Managed social is offered as a subscription-based service; each comes with volume-based discounts and a 15 day trial. No credit card required to start your trial.

### Pricing

### Which tier to choose

This depends on where you are currently at with your social marketing strategy. Here's a quick rundown of main features per tier.

#### Starter

If you currently have zero visibility on social and want to get your feet wet, try our `Starter` tier.
Although the Starter tier is limited to 6 generated posts per month, it lets you schedule and post as many manual posts as you want.

#### Growth

The big difference with the `Growth` tier is you get access to your virtual sales team that's optimized to take control over your DMs and reply to comments on your posts with the intent of converting a potential guest to a confirmed booking.

#### Elite

Elite is a big jump in features. You immediately get access to integrate our AI chatbot into your own website.
It's built on the same technologies as `Automated DMs & Replies` but with more customization options to go with your site.
Elite also gives you premium support that can help you with integration.

Elite also gives you access to [Wink Agency](/agency/what-is-agency) for the first time where we pair your property with an army of influencers and other affiliates who can help you sell your property to their audiences.

#### Enterprise

Enterprise is for those brands and chains that want a group discount on multiple pricing tiers at reduced prices.
It also comes with the ability to `boost` content on supported platforms. Select the posts you want to boost across multiple social networks.
You will be invoiced for the desired ad spend you wish to use for 3 / 6 / 12 months.
