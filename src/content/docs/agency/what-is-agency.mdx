## Connecting hotels with influencers

Wink Agency is a global influencer marketing service that helps hotels collaborate with social media influencers to reach their target audiences. Our goal is to make influencer marketing straightforward and measurable for hotels by handling the entire process—from planning to execution to tracking results. We focus on creating campaigns that align with a hotel's goals, whether that's increasing brand awareness, driving website visits, or boosting bookings.

## Measured social

Wink Agency provides a full-service approach to influencer marketing, tailored specifically for the hotel industry. Here's how we support hotels:

1. **Campaign planning and strategy**
   We start by understanding a hotel's goals, budget, and target markets. For example, a hotel might want to attract more guests from a specific region or promote a new package. Our team, which includes campaign managers, digital marketing specialists, and media experts, works with the hotel to define key performance indicators (KPIs) and create a campaign plan that reflects their vision.

2. **Influencer selection**
   Choosing the right influencers is critical. We identify influencers on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube whose audiences match the hotel's target demographic. We ensure these influencers are authentic and capable of creating content that resonates with their followers, such as storytelling posts or videos that highlight the hotel's unique features.

3. **Campaign execution**
   Once influencers are selected, we manage the collaboration process. This includes coordinating content creation, ensuring it aligns with the hotel's brand, and using a standard contract that clearly outlines what the hotel can expect from each influencer. The contract covers deliverables, timelines, and responsibilities to keep everything transparent.

4. **Tracking & Analytics**
   Measuring the success of an influencer campaign can be challenging, but we make it clear and actionable. We use tools like tracking pixels, custom promo codes, and analytics platforms to monitor every step of the campaign. For example, if a hotel wants to drive bookings, we track metrics like website visits, clicks, leads, and actual reservations. This creates a clear funnel showing how many people were reached, engaged, and converted into customers.

5. **Reporting**
   After the campaign, we provide detailed reports that break down the results. These reports include metrics like reach, engagement, and return on investment (ROI). Our goal is to give hotels a complete picture of how the campaign performed and how it contributed to their business objectives.

## Why influencer marketing matters

Influencer marketing allows hotels to connect with potential guests in an authentic way. Unlike traditional ads, influencers create content that feels personal and trustworthy, which can inspire their followers to visit a hotel or book a stay. We like to call this `Trust-Based Travel`. However, running these campaigns effectively requires expertise in selecting influencers, crafting campaigns, and measuring results. That's where Wink Agency comes in—we simplify the process and provide tools to track success.

## How we calculate ROI

One of the biggest challenges in influencer marketing is understanding the return on investment. Hotels often wonder whether the money spent on influencers translates into real results. We address this by using data-driven tools to track every action in the campaign. For instance:
- If the goal is to drive bookings, we monitor how many users visit the hotel's booking page via influencer links or promo codes and how many complete a reservation.
- If the goal is brand awareness, we measure metrics like post reach, likes, comments, and shares.

By connecting these metrics to the hotel's goals, we provide a clear picture of the campaign's impact. This helps hotels see the value of their investment and make informed decisions for future campaigns.

## Our approach

Wink Agency operates globally, working with hotels in all markets and on multiple platforms. We focus on creating campaigns that are:
- **Authentic**: Content feels genuine and aligns with the influencer's voice and the hotel's brand.
- **Scalable**: Campaigns can be adjusted to fit different budgets or expanded to reach larger audiences.
- **Results-Oriented**: We prioritize measurable outcomes, ensuring hotels can see the impact of their campaigns.

Our team handles all aspects of the process, so hotels can focus on their core operations while we manage the marketing. Whether a hotel is new to influencer marketing or looking to refine its strategy, we provide the expertise and tools needed to succeed.
