## Actions

Actions allow you to interact with the inventory or supplier. We have 3 main categories that lets you do the following:

1. ***Supplier details*** How can I know more about the supplier?
2. ***Create...*** How can I convert this inventory into to something I can sell?
3. ***Add to...*** How can I save this inventory into lists that I can sell at the same time?
