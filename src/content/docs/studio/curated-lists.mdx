Curated lists is a feature that lets you group and sort inventory that you've selected from things that you found while searching for travel inventory.
Once created, you can expose the list to your users by making it available for sale as a [grid](/studio/grids) or a [map](/studio/maps) through [WinkLinks](/link-manager/wink-links), our [WordPress plugin](/developers/wordpress/) or by embedding one of our [Web Components](/developers/web-components) into your site.

By default, every affiliate account starts with a `Favorites` list which you can use right away. `Favorites` is special and cannot be removed.
All curated lists allow you to do the following:
