Historically, getting access to, and selling, anything travel-related involved NDAs and complex integrations between two [or more] licensed travel agent companies that had enough technical expertise, access to a payment gateway and were both PCI DSS compliant. It was a costly and time consuming effort and the barrier to entry was impossibly high for normal people.

Wink makes selling travel inventory, or even being your own Online Travel Agency, accessible for everyone and as easy as sharing a link.

The affiliate portal exposes available travel inventory from suppliers anywhere in the world. Your task is to find the inventory that’s right for you. We offer a way for you to browse through hotels, the hotels’ individual facilities and experiences. Filter on the things that are matter to you, such as price, commission paid, location and a whole lot more.
