Saved searches does what its name implies. While searching for travel inventory, you have the option to save your search query for later use.

## Saving your search query

When you start searching for inventory (see [Search](/studio/search)), you have the ability to fine-tune your search filters. 
At the bottom of the query form is the option to `Save search`.

<CloudinaryImage 
      width="350"
      height="329"
      resize="scale"
      quality="best"
      alt="Save a search"
      src="academy/save-search" 
      errorImage="noimage_opaque_nyrtl0.png"
    />
    <figcaption>*Shows link to Save search query*</figcaption>
</figure>

Clicking on this link will give you a chance to name this search (*e.g. My Library of Magic Hotels*) something you will remember for later.

<CloudinaryImage 
      width="350"
      height="329"
      resize="scale"
      quality="best"
      alt="Give your search a name"
      src="academy/name-save-search" 
      errorImage="noimage_opaque_nyrtl0.png"
    />
    <figcaption>*Give your search a name*</figcaption>
</figure>

Give it a name and click on the `Save search` button. After that, you can navigate to `Inventory > Saves Searches` from the top navigation bar to see your newly created record.

## List actions

Your saved search can be used to expose travel inventory to your users in the form of a grid or a map and make your search results display in the way you want.

      height="939"
      resize="scale"
      quality="best"
      alt="Saved search actions"
      src="academy/saved-search-actions" 
      errorImage="noimage_opaque_nyrtl0.png"
    />
    <figcaption>*Saved search query with no filters applied*</figcaption>
</figure>

Every saved search query has actions you can execute on it:

- Convert the search query to a [map](/studio/maps). 
- Convert the search query to a [grid](/studio/grids).
- Remove the saved search.
