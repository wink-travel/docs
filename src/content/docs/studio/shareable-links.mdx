Shareable links is a core feature of Wink and it rose out of the need to communicate inventory and pricing in a dynamic way through the simplest way possible on the Internet; namely the hyper link.

<h4 align="center">[https://trvl.as/s/3xWCH](https://trvl.as/s/3xWCH)</h4>

Above is an example of one of our links. It's short and portable... even short enough to remember. Though short, this link packs an ***explosive*** amount of information, such as:

- Your App ID.
- Your Affiliate ID.
- The image(s) and text to display to the user.
- The look-n-feel (*i.e. theme, colors and more*).
- The itinerary to use for our price query (*2 adults, 1 night*).
- The currency to display price in.
- The language to display text in.

The rest of this article walks you through how to create, customize and share your links.

## Create a link

Above is an image taken from [Search](/studio/search) and shows you some of the things you can do with your search results. One of those actions is `Make a link`. 
Click on that button and it will redirect you to our shareable link form page where you can start customizing your link.

## Customize link

 The form lets you customize your link in the following ways:

<Steps>
 1. Give it a name for you to remember what the link is about.
 2. Select the [Customization](/studio/customization) you want to apply to this link.
 3. Add keywords, separated by a comma, that will be used by [Web Crawlers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Crawler).
 4. Optionally enter you X account handle or Facebook App ID.
 5. Add titles and descriptions in the languages you want the user to see.
 6. Select one, or more, images that will show when you share the link on platforms such as Facebook or LinkedIn.
 7. Choose a theme / overlay that adds a branded design on top of the image(s) you selected. *Note: This is how you get prices to display on top of the image.*
 8. Click the `Save` button to continue.
 </Steps>

Above shows you an image with all the available actions for your link:

- ***Preview*** Shows you a quick overview of how the link was configured and what it will look like to the user.
- ***Update*** Updates your link configuration.
- ***Add to WinkLinks*** Adds the link to your WinkLinks account.
- ***Copy*** Copies the link to your clipboard so you can easily share it anywhere you want (*including [WinkLinks](/link-manager/wink-links)*).
- ***Share*** Opens up a new window with options to share on many social networks and messaging platforms.
- ***QR code*** Generates a QR code that you can share on platforms like IG that are more image-focused.
- ***Embed*** Shows you how to embed this link as an [Ad Banner](/developers/web-components#content-loader) into your website. 
- ***Use with WordPress*** Shows you how to use our [WordPress plugin](/developers/wordpress) to embed this link into your website.

We cover some of these options, in more detail, below.

### Preview

      resize="scale"
      quality="best"
      alt="Preview"

      errorImage="noimage_opaque_nyrtl0.png"
    />
    <figcaption>*Shareable link preview*</figcaption>
</figure>

When you click on `Preview`, you will see an image with your theme applied. When you share the link on social media, such as Facebook, you can expect to see the same thing show up in your feed along with your title and description.


### Social Share

      src="academy/shareable-link-share" 
      errorImage="noimage_opaque_nyrtl0.png"
    />
    <figcaption>*Social share options*</figcaption>

If you click on the `Share` button, a new window opens up with a convenient way for you to share directly to your favorite social networks and messaging apps. 
Click any of the icon buttons to continue posting your link on that network. *Note: Some buttons will only show when you are sharing from your mobile device.*

### QR code

      errorImage="noimage_opaque_nyrtl0.png"
    />
    <figcaption>*Share via QR code*</figcaption>
</figure>

If you'd like to share a QR code instead of a link, click the `QR code` button and new window will appear with your QR code. 

How to save your QR code:

- If you are on your laptop, right click on the image and select to `Save image`.
- If you are on your mobile phone:
    - Press down and hold your finger on top of the image until an option appears to save the image to your Photos.
    - Take a screenshot of the QR code, crop it to fit, and save to Photos.

### Embed

```html {3, 6-9, 11, 13-16}
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://elements.wink.travel/styles.css"></link>
  </head>
  <body>
    <wink-content-loader
       layout="AD_BANNER"
       id="3xWCH"
    ></wink-content-loader>

    <script src="https://elements.wink.travel/elements.js" type="module" defer></script>

      client-id="YOUR CLIENT ID GOES HERE"
      configuration-id="YOUR CUSTOMIZATION ID GOES HERE"
    ></wink-app-loader>
  </body>
