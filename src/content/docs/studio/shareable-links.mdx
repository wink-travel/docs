Shareable links is a core feature of Wink and it rose out of the need to communicate inventory and pricing in a dynamic way through the simplest way possible on the Internet; namely the hyper link.

<h4 align="center">[https://trvl.as/s/3xWCH](https://trvl.as/s/3xWCH)</h4>

Above is an example of one of our links. It's short and portable... even short enough to remember. Though short, this link packs an ***explosive*** amount of information, such as:

- Your App ID
- Your Affiliate ID
- The image(s) and text to display to the user
- The look-n-feel (*i.e. theme, colors and more*)
- The itinerary to use for our price query (*2 adults, 1 night*)
- The currency to display price in
- The language to display text in

The rest of this article walks you through how to create, customize and share your links.

## Create a link

Above is an image taken from [Search](/studio/search) and shows you some of the things you can do to the inventory you find. One of those actions is `Create a link`. 
Click on that button and it will redirect you to our shareable link form page where you can start customiing your link.

## Customize link

 The shareable link form lets you customize the link in the following ways:

 1. Give it a name for you to remember what the link is about.
 2. Select the [Customization](/studio/customization) you want to apply to this link.
 3. Add keywords, separated by a comma, that will be used by [Web Crawlers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Crawler).
 4. Optionally enter you X account handle or Facebook App ID.
 5. Add titles and descriptions in any language you want that the user will see.
 6. Select one, or more, images that will show when you share the link on platforms such as Facebook or LinkedIn.
 7. Choose a theme / overlay that adds a branded design on top of the image(s) you selected. *Note: This is how you get prices to display on top of the image.*
 8. Click the `Save` button to continue.
