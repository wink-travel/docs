[Wink Studio](https://studio.wink.travel) connects you with travel inventory worldwide. This article steps you through creating and manging your affiliate accounts on Wink.

## Create account

Once you are authenticated, you will be redirected to your [accounts page](https://studio.wink.travel/company/list) that shows you all your affiliate accounts.

Click the `Create new account` button to continue. You will be redirected to our [account creation](https://studio.wink.travel/company/create) page. 

Fill in all required fields.

<Steps>
1. **Name** The name of your account. *This does not need to be your real name but will be something users see when looking at your WinkLinks page or when suppliers want to connect with you directly.*
2. **Entity type** Whether you are a company or individual. *Mostly used to determine how you are eligible to receive funds.*
3. **Type** Choose a type that applies best to your account. *e.g. Influencer* 
4. **Description** Write a description for your account. *This will be seen on your WinkLinks page and when suppliers want to connect with you directly.*
5. **Website** Enter your main website. *This can be your IG account URL or company website. It should be the place you do most of your online work. Suppliers will go to these links when they determine whether to connect with you.*

2. Click on `Account > Profile` in the top navigation bar.
3. On the Profile page, you will be able to update your existing profile and add additional information to it.

Your user profile picture is mostly for internal use.

## Managers

You can invite other users to help manage your affiliate account. Once a user accepts your invite, they will have full access to your account with the exception of payment. You will always be the only one in charge of the funds that you own.

<Steps>

2. Click on `Account > Managers` in the top navigation bar.
3. Add the e-mail of the user you want to make into an account manager.
4. Click the `Invite` link next to the email.
</Steps>

Wink will send the user an email to accept or reject your invitation.

## Notifications

At times, we want to get in touch with you. When that happens, you will see the bell in the top right corner change. 
To read what we sent you:

<Steps>
1. Click on `Account > Notifications` in the top navigation bar.
2. You will see new and past notifications.
3. Choose to `Mark as read` or `Delete` the notifications once you've read them.
</Steps>
