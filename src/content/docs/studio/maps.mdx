A map represents either a single supplier (e.g. hotel or experience provider) or inventory (i.e. room type, meeting room, spa etc) or a collection of inventory such as a curated list or saved search and exposes those details via an interactive map containing bookable map markers.
A user can interact with a map in the following ways:

<figure>
<CloudinaryImage
      width="700"
      height="393"
      resize="scale"
      quality="best"
      alt="Map with markers"
      src="academy/map-example"
      errorImage="noimage_opaque_nyrtl0.png"
    />
    <figcaption>*Map with map markers*</figcaption>
</figure>

- Zoom, pan and drag the map to see available inventory.
- Click on a map marker to see inventory details in the form of a [Card](/studio/cards).

      height="568"
      resize="scale"
      quality="best"
      alt="Map with card open"
      src="academy/map-example-card"
      errorImage="noimage_opaque_nyrtl0.png"
    />

The rest of this article walks you through how to create, customize and share your maps.

## Create a map

Maps can be created in two ways:

- **Single marker map**: Create a map from something you found while [searching](/studio/search).
- **Multi marker map**: Create a map from a [curated list](/studio/curated-lists) or [saved search](/studio/saved-searches).

### Single marker map

<figure>
<CloudinaryImage
      width="350"
      height="238"
      resize="scale"
      quality="best"
      alt="Actions"
      src="academy/inventory-actions"
      errorImage="noimage_opaque_nyrtl0.png"
    />
    <figcaption>*Search results actions*</figcaption>
</figure>

Above is an image taken from [Search](/studio/search) and shows you some of the things you can do with your search results. One of those actions is `Make a map`.
Click on that button and it will redirect you to our map form page where you can start customizing your map.

### Multi marker map

Both [curated lists](/studio/curated-lists#list-actions) and [saved searches](/studio/saved-searches#list-actions) come with an action that lets you create a map. This map will contain map markers for all inventory within those lists.

## Customize map

 The form lets you customize your map in the following ways:

<Steps>
 1. Give it a name for you to remember what the map is about.
 2. Choose whether you want the user to be allowed to move around the map.
 3. Set how tall, in pixels, you want the map to be.
 4. Choose whether you want the user to be allowed to zoom in and out of the map.
 5. Choose a map style that goes with the website you will be embedding the map into.
 6. Choose a marker color.
 7. Select the initial card face you want users to see first. By default, it is the native face of that inventory.
 8. You can add your own markers, circles, rectangles and polygons to indicate other locations on the map your users might find interesting.
 9. Click the `Save` button to continue.
</Steps>

After saving your map, you are redirected to your maps page and your map is now ready to be shared with the world.

## Share map

      resize="scale"
      quality="best"
      alt="Map"
      src="academy/map"
      errorImage="noimage_opaque_nyrtl0.png"
    />

Above shows you an image with all the available actions for your map:

- **Update** Updates your map configuration.
- **Add to WinkLinks** Adds the map to your WinkLinks account.
- **Embed** Shows you how to embed this map as a [Map](/developers/web-components/#content-loader) into your website.
- **Use with WordPress** Shows you how to use our [WordPress plugin](/developers/wordpress) to embed this map into your website.

We cover some of these options, in more detail, below.

### Embed

```html {3, 6-9, 11, 13-16}
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://elements.wink.travel/styles.css"></link>
  </head>
  <body>
    <wink-content-loader
       layout="MAP"
       id="64d7cbc8-61df-11ef-9722-42004e494300"
    ></wink-content-loader>

    <script src="https://elements.wink.travel/elements.js" type="module" defer></script>

    <wink-app-loader
      client-id="YOUR CLIENT ID GOES HERE"
      configuration-id="YOUR CUSTOMIZATION ID GOES HERE"
    ></wink-app-loader>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here is how to embed your map into your site:

- Line 3 shows you how to embed the Wink styles into your site.
- Lines 6 through 9 shows you how to use the [wink-content-loader](/developers/web-components/#content-loader) Web Component and tell it to fetch an ad banner for your code.
- Line 11 shows you how to embed our Javascript into your site.
- Line 13 shows you how to embed the [wink-app-loader](/developers/web-components/#application-loader) Web Component and tell it to fetch your page-level configuration preferences.
