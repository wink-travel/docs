A grid represents a list of suppliers and inventory and exposes the details via an interactive, bookable, grid UI. 
The grid supports displaying any inventory from your curated list or saved search.
A user interacts with a grid the same way she interacts with an individual [card](/studio/cards) with one additional feature:

1. Paginate through the grid by clicking the `Show more` button (*when more items are available*).

Above is an example of our grid showing a list of room type cards.

The rest of this article walks you through how to create, customize and expose the grid to your users.

## Grid types

There are three types of grids: 

1. Grid based on a [curated list](/studio/curated-lists#list-actions).
2. Grid based on a [saved search](/studio/saved-searches#list-actions).
3. Grid grid based on a location and sort criteria (*i.e. Ranked grid*).

## Curated list grid

This is a grid that uses the inventory you've collected in one of your curated lists and converts the list to bookable travel inventory you can show to your users.

### Create

Navigate to `Inventory > Curated Lists` from the top navigation bar. For this example, we will use your `Favorites` list. 
If you haven't yet added anything to your `Favorites`, go to [Search](/studio/search) to learn how.

      src="academy/create-curated-list-grid" 
      errorImage="noimage_opaque_nyrtl0.png"
    />
    <figcaption>*Create curated list grid form*</figcaption>
</figure>

<Steps>
1. Click the `Actions` button on the `Favorites` list.
2. Click the `Create a grid` button.
3. A new window will display, allowing you to name your grid. *See below*.
4. Click `OK` button to continue.
</Steps>

Your grid has been created. Navigate to `Tools > Grids` from the top navigation bar and click the `Curated Grids` tab to see your new grid.


### Customize 

The form lets you customize your grid in the following ways:

<Steps>
 1. Give it a name for you to remember what the grid is about.
 2. Select the [Customization](/studio/customization) you want to apply to this grid.
 3. Select the initial card face you want users to see first. By default, it is the native face of that inventory.
 4. Select the badge you want to use on the card. A badge lets users compare inventory on an aggregate metric such as `eco-friendly`.
 5. Add keywords, separated by a comma, that will be used by [Web Crawlers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Crawler).
 6. Add titles and descriptions in the languages you want the user to see.
 7. Click the `Save` button to continue.
</Steps>
