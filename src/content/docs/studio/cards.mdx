A card represents a single supplier (e.g. hotel or experience provider) or inventory (i.e. room type, meeting room, spa etc) and exposes the details via an interactive, bookable, card UI. 
A user can interact with a card in the following ways:

- Click the `Book` button.
- Click the `Gallery` link to see all photos and videos for this inventory.
- Click `Best deal` link, if available, to see the best priced room.
- Click `Hotel details` link, if available, to see property information. 

A card supports multiple faces to minimize the size of the card and to categorize the data; making it easily consumable by the user and gives you a greater chance to convert the user to a booking.

A card has either two or three faces: 

- A hotel card shows property data on the front and the best room type on the back. The price, on both sides, displays the best price for the hotel.
- A room type card shows room type data on the front and property data on the back. The price displays the price of the room type on the front and the best price for the hotel on the back.
- All other cards (e.g. spa restaurant etc) have 3 faces. Example: Spa data displays on the front page with the best price of the spa. Room type data for the best priced room is on the second side. Property data along with the best priced room is on the third card face.

The rest of this article walks you through how to create, customize and expose the card to your users.

Above is an image taken from [Search](/studio/search) and shows you some of the things you can do with your search results. One of those actions is `Make a card`. 
Click on that button and it will redirect you to our card form page where you can start customizing your card.

## Customize card

 The form lets you customize your card in the following ways:

<Steps>
 1. Give it a name for you to remember what the card is about.
 2. Select the [Customization](/studio/customization) you want to apply to this card.
 3. Select the initial card face you want users to see first. By default, it is the native face of that inventory.
 4. Select the <Badge text="badge" variant="tip" size="small" /> you want to use on the card. A badge lets users compare inventory on an aggregate metric such as `eco-friendly`.
 5. Add keywords, separated by a comma, that will be used by [Web Crawlers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Crawler).
 5. Add titles and descriptions in the languages you want the user to see.
 6. Select one, or more, images that will show when users click on the `Gallery` link.
 7. Click the `Save` button to continue.
 </Steps>

 After saving your card, you are redirected to your cards page and your card is now ready to be shared with the world.
