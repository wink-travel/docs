A link manager lets you save and organize URLs you like for later. Your browser bookmarks is an example of a link manager. With the advent of social media, there came a greater need for exposing and making links available to your friends and audiences. Your Facebook feed is an example of a social-friendly link manager.

Our link manager tool, WinkLinks, goes further. 

- It gives you a vanity url, such as [https://i.trvl.as/bob](https://i.trvl.as/bob), for times when sites like IG only allows you to share a single URL and it lets you manage links from all over the web. Also, if the site supports `rich content`, like Spotify does, WinkLinks makes that playlist playable or makes a Facebook video watchable. 
- WinkLinks lets you add all your existing affiliate links, like CJ and Amazon, for free.
- WinkLinks is also the easiest way for anyone to sell travel inventory with just 2 clicks. It's a slimmed-down booking engine with a focus on converting your audience to bookings.

To manage your WinkLinks account, log into your affiliate account on [Wink Studio](https://studio.wink.travel).
