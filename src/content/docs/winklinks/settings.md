To manage your WinkLinks settings, navigate to `WinkLinks` in the top navigation bar and click on the `Settings` tab.

Here are the ways you can configure your WinkLinks behavior with `Settings`:

- ***Intelligent*** By enabling intelligence, we try to retrieve the `rich` content available from sites like, `Wink`, `Spotify`, `Instagram`, `Facebook`, `YouTube`, `X (formerly Twitter)` and others. *e.g. If you share an IG post on WinkLinks, the post will be displayed as you see it on IG, with likes, comments and a way to interact with the post.*
- ***Initial display*** Control how your audience first interacts with your site and sees your content. There are three options available to you:
    - `Column-based` design. This is our preferred design and if you don't display too much content, it will look great on your page. However, it can get `heavy` if you're sharing' a lot of rich content. 
    - `Row-based` design. This is one way of making your content a bit less heavy for browsers to consume but we recommend that your content has similar amount of text to make the cards align better. 
    - `List-based` design. Most other link managers display a simple list with a url and minimal content. Choose this way of displaying your content if you have a lot of content and want to display it as quickly as possible.
- ***Profile picture*** At the top of every WinkLinks page is your account profile picture along with your account description. You can display your profile picture in twos ways:
    - `Circle` We recommend using a circular style if your picture is of yourself or anything else that fits inside a round container.
    - `Rectangle` We recommend using a rectangular stype if your company logo is your profile picture as most company logos are rectangular in nature. 
- ***Customization*** Choose which customization you want to use for your WinkLinks page. This affects your theme colors as well as your itinerary when displaying Wink inventory cards, maps or grids.
