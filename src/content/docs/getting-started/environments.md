At Wink, we run 2 environments for everything we do at all times:

- Production is our stable environment.
- Staging is our certification and testing environment.

If you are an integrator, a hotel or travel agent that wish to prepare for certification or test the Wink platform, create an account in our staging environment to get started.

:::note
The staging environment is available on a request-basis. It means it will go to sleep if there is no usage and turn itself back on when there is. Please be patient if you are waking it up. It takes about a minute to start all the servers after you first connect with one of our servers or apps.
