All of Wink's services are free for everyone to use. Wink charges `5.5% per booking` to maintain the platform. 
Most of that goes to the payment gateway (Visa, MasterCard etc). An average booking costs us `2.95%` to acquire; sometimes as high as `3.6%`. Partial refunds set us back further as the payment gateway sees this as new charge. 
We want to be completely transparent about pricing now to save everyone some time before trying to negotiate further discounts before having used Wink. Our pricing model is more than fair and we need to make a living too.

## Wink vs IBE

Some hotels try to compare us to their internet booking engine that came bundled with their channel manager and ask us to give them a fixed, monthly, price based on the number of keys to their property.

We are not an IBE and hopefully [Wink Academy](/) clarifies that. There are pros and cons to any service. If your IBE works for your property, stick with that. 
Wink exists to fill several voids in the travel industry and bring it all together in one place. You don't have to replace your IBE but you could give it a try on one of your social media accounts to see how it compares. You don't pay anything if there are no bookings so what do you have to lose? ðŸ˜‰

## Future services

We will offer optional subscription-based services in the future that make it even easier to sell for everyone or offer managed affiliate accounts that do the selling for you. If that interests you, get your voice heard by emailing us at [hi@wink.travel](mailto:hi@wink.travel).

Stay tuned.

## Platform effect

Finally, as we continue to grow in both size and bookings, we want to be able to share some of the platform effects with you. More bookings bring opportunities for volume discounts from our payment gateway which would allow us to lower our processing fee for everyone.
