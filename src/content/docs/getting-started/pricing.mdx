All of Wink's services are free for everyone to use. Wink charges `5.5% per booking` to maintain the platform. Most of that goes to the payment gateway (Visa, MasterCard etc). An average booking costs us 2.95%; sometimes as high as 3.6%. Partial refunds set us back further as the payment gateway sees this as new charge. We want to be completely trasparent about pricing now to save everyone some time in trying to negotiate further discounts before having used Wink. Our pricing model is more than fair and we need to make a living too.

We might offer optional subscription-based services in the future that make it even easier to sell for everyone or to offer managed affiliate accounts that do the selling for you. If that interests you, get your voice counted by emailing us at [hi@wink.travel](mailto:hi@wink.travel).

Finally, as we continue to grow in both size and bookings, we want to be able to share some of the platform effects with you. More bookings bring opportunities for volume discounts from our payment gateway which would allow us to lower our processing fee for everyone.

Join the Wink revolution today and discover a new way to thrive in the hospitality industry!
