## Core concepts

> You see one... you've seen them all

As you familiarize yourself with all of Wink's features, there is plenty of overlap in how things work. 
Understanding the core concepts will give you greater familiarity and more confidence as you work through our features.

Here we go:

- Every section usually has a way to list, add, update and remove entries.
- When you're editing an entry, a red asterix <Badge text="*" variant="danger" size="large" /> on a form field means it's required.
- If a specific form field is incorrect, you will see a red border around it with red text explaining what the problem is underneath the form field.
- You will only be able to `Save` a form once the form is valid and some changes have been made to it.
- Some forms encompass multiple tabs, such as the guest room form. 
- All tabs need to be valid before you can continue. 
- A tab containing missing or invalid form data, will display a yellow triangle <Badge text="⚠️" variant="caution" size="large" /> next to its name.
- When submitting a form, most forms will display a `Confirmation` dialog asking you if you want to continue.
