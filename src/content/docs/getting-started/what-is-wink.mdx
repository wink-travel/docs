## Key Features

### Booking Engine

At the heart of Wink, is a powerful, whitelabeled and highly customizable booking engine. It has all the features you've come to expect from a booking engine such as real-time pricing, information about the property, its amenities, facilities, location and more. It includes support for different ranking categories such as eco-friendliness, lifestyles and reviews. It allows travelers to create a detailed traveler profile it can share that informs hotels of their preferences, what kind of allergies they have, emergency numbers and much more. 

Where our booking engine really shines is its support for Attribute Based Selling (ABS). Much like a budget airline's ability to upsell better seats with more leg room, luggage options and meals, our booking engine gives properties a whole new perspective on what upselling should look like. From in-room ancillaries to reserving a meeting room or booking a restaurant experience, either on or off the premises... With Wink, properties can make their entire neighboor come to life with deals and experiences that will titillate travelers.

### Social Share

Social share lets you share the travel inventory you found on Wink directly on social media. The link comes with dynamic link previews that show price overlaid on a beautful picture of the property that you chose. We think this feature simplifies how guests discover and book their favorite hotels and experiences and lowers the conversion barrier from social feed to booking​​.

### Link Manager

A link manager does what its name implies: It lets you save and organize URLs you like for later. Your brower bookmarks is an example of a link manager. With the advent of social media, there came a greater need for exposing and making links available to your friends and audiences. Your Facebook feed is an example of a social-friendly link manager.

Our link manager tool, WinkLinks, goes further. 

1. It gives you a vanity url, such as [https://i.trvl.as/bob](https://i.trvl.as/bob), ror times, when sites like IG only allows you to share a single URL and it lets you manage links from all over the web. Also, if the site supports `rich content`, like Spotify does, WinkLinks makes that playlist playable or makes a Facebook video watchable. 
2. WinkLinks lets you add all your existing affiliate links, like CJ and Amazon, for free.
3. WinkLinks is also the easiest way for anyone to sell travel inventory with just 2 clicks. It's a slimmed-down booking engine with a focus on converting your audience to bookings.

WinkLinks is highly customizable and supports the needs of your brand.

### Affiliate Network

The booking engine is our core product but the affiliate network is what makes our platform come alive. Wink lets properties connect with affiliates and vice versa. The two can negotiate deals, commissions and discounts. Instead of speculating whether the relationship makes sense, the property can see the past performance of the affiliate along with the segment of travelers it brings to the table. Even without a direct connection, affiliates will have access to generally available rates and deals. 

Wink makes inventory available in a variety to affiliates. We track the analytics of every booking, your ROIs and we are responsible for paying everyone involved. You can focus on what you do best; namely selling to your audience.

### Hotel Portal

Wink's Extranet is the most advanced content management system for properties to sell room types, facilities, experiences and ancillaries of any kind online. We designed this system, first and foremost, with easy-of-use in mind, seconded only by the need for hotels to sell more than ever before. We leverage AI throughout the user journey to assist and speed up a property's `time-to-market`. What used to take weeks is now done in less than an hour. 

Our Extranet is a self-serve system for properties to reach a world wide audience.

### Integration

> “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” -- Sir Isaac Newton

A platform like this is not built in isolation. Rather, it's the sum of many working parts and we want to continue to serve others who come after us. Wink was built using an `API-driven approach`. It roughly equates to: whatever features we build for ourselves should be consumable by others. As a result of this design philosophy, all of Wink's platform features can be interacted with as an external developer as if the system was your own. There are also other aspects to the platform that you can leverage when integrating with us. 

1. **Apps** Build your own applications on top of Wink and use our OAuth2 authentication server for permission-based services.
2. **Webhooks** Subscribe to platform-based events that relate to your accounts and execute follow-up actions from within your own system.
3. **Channel Manager** We have dedicated channel manager endpoints for Property Management Systems, Channel managers and Central Reservation Systems wishing to send us property rates and availability.
4. **Web Components** Embed bookable travel inventory directly into your own site with minimum coding necessary. We have all the components you need to be a full-fledged online travel agency.

## Pricing

All of Wink's services are free for everyone to use. Wink charges `5.5% per booking` to maintain the platform. Most of that goes to the payment gateway we use. An average booking costs us 2.95%; sometimes as high as 3.6%. Partial refunds set us back even further as the payment gateway sees this as new charge. We are saying this now to save everyone some time in trying to negotiate further discounts before having used Wink. Our pricing model is more than fair and we need to make a living too.

We might offer optional subscription-based services in the future that make it even easier to sell for everyone or to offer managed affiliate accounts that do the selling for you. If that interests you, get your voice counted by emailing us at [hi@wink.travel](mailto:hi@wink.travel).

Finally, as we continue to grow in both size and bookings, we want to be able to share some of the platform effects with you. More bookings bring opportunities for volume discounts from our payment gateway which would allow us to lower our processing fee for everyone.

Join the Wink revolution today and discover a new way to thrive in the hospitality industry!
