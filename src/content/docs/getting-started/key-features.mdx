- Easily sell facilities and experiences through social media or online.
- Upsell travelers during the booking process.
- Find an affiliate network that caters to travel where you earn a direct commission. 
- Leverage an affiliate network to sell across 1000s of sales channels with no extra effort; thereby reducing cost and risk.
- Retain customer ownership for re-targeting.
- Monetize on their social influence.
- Integrate with a travel platform that didn't require a lengthy NDA and long wait times.
- Properly track ROIs when partnering with affiliates. 
- ...and more

Over time, new features were added, existing features expanded upon and some removed. If you work in the travel space, or just like / need to travel, we have a compelling reason for you to join Wink. Keep reading to find out why. 

The below features make up the core of Wink.

## Booking engine

At the heart of Wink, is a powerful, whitelabeled and highly customizable booking engine. It has all the features you've come to expect from a booking engine, such as real-time pricing, information about the property, its amenities, facilities, location and more. It includes support for different ranking categories such as eco-friendliness, lifestyles and reviews. It allows travelers to create a detailed traveler profile it can share that informs hotels of their preferences, what kind of allergies they have, emergency numbers and much more. 

Our booking engine makes each property and destination look stunning with its beautifully designed interface. But, where it really sets itself apart from the rest, is its ability to upsell travelers on anything, in and around its premises. Much like a budget airline incentivizes passengers to upgrade to better seats with more leg room, increased luggage allotment and meals... Wink gives properties clarity on what upselling should look like. From in-room ancillaries, booking a meeting room or reserving a table at a local restaurant, to museums, nature hikes and water parks... Wink enables properties with the power to make their entire neighboor come to life with deals and experiences that will stun travelers.

Our focus is letting the traveler in on the bigger experience and to connect properties with their guests at a higher price point before arrival.

## Social share

Our social share feature is all about making it easy to produce, share and consume travel deals on social media or anywhere else online. The most widely used method of sharing anything online is <ins>the link</ins>. Our link comes with dynamic link previews that show price overlaid on a beautiful picture of your choosing. This feature expedites how travelers discover and book, and increases the conversion path from social feed to booking​​.

## Link manager

A link manager lets you save and organize URLs you like for later. Your browser bookmarks is an example of a link manager. With the advent of social media, there came a greater need for exposing and making links available to your friends and audiences. Your Facebook feed is an example of a social-friendly link manager.

Our link manager tool, WinkLinks, goes further. 

- It gives you a vanity url, such as [https://i.trvl.as/bob](https://i.trvl.as/bob), for times when sites like IG only allows you to share a single URL and it lets you manage links from all over the web. Also, if the site supports `rich content`, like Spotify does, WinkLinks makes that playlist playable or makes a Facebook video watchable. 
- WinkLinks lets you add all your existing affiliate links, like CJ and Amazon, for free.
- WinkLinks is also the easiest way for anyone to sell travel inventory with just 2 clicks. It's a slimmed-down booking engine with a focus on converting your audience to bookings.

WinkLinks is highly customizable and supports the needs of your brand.

## Affiliate network

The booking engine is our core product but the affiliate network is what makes our platform come alive. Wink lets properties connect with affiliates and vice versa. The two can negotiate deals, commissions and discounts. Instead of speculating whether the relationship makes sense, the property can see the past performance of the affiliate along with the segment of travelers it brings to the table. Even without a direct connection, affiliates will have access to generally available rates and deals. 

Wink makes inventory available in a variety to affiliates. We track the analytics of every booking, your ROIs and we are responsible for paying everyone involved. You can focus on what you do best; namely selling to your audience.

## Property portal

Wink's Extranet is the most advanced content management system for properties to sell room types, facilities, experiences and ancillaries of any kind online. We designed this system, first and foremost, with easy-of-use in mind, seconded only by the need for hotels to sell more than ever before. We leverage AI throughout the user journey to assist and speed up a property's `time-to-market`. What used to take weeks is now done in less than an hour. 

Our Extranet is a self-serve system for properties to connect with affiliates and reach a world wide audience of travelers.
