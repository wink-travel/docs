All of Wink's services are free for everyone to use. When there is a booking, Wink charges a small fee to maintain the platform.

Wink supports both the merchant and agent models.

## Model 1

Wink is the merchant of record at the time the booking occurs. Wink is responsible for the funds and carries, any and all, licenses to operate a travel agency.
This model applies to 95% of all bookings

Wink charges `5.5% per booking` to maintain the platform. 
Most of that goes to the payment gateway (Visa, MasterCard etc). An average booking costs us `2.95%` to acquire; sometimes as high as `3.6%`. Partial refunds set us back further as the payment gateway sees this as new charge. 
We want to be completely transparent about pricing now to save everyone some time before trying to negotiate further discounts before having used Wink. Our pricing model is more than fair and we need to make a living too.

## Model 2

This model is only available to travel agencies who hold a travel agency license in their region and who desire to be the merchant of record. Some of our registered travel agents want to be responsible for handling the payment and disbursing of funds to hotels. Under this model, they are responsible for the funds and carry the necessary licenses to operate in their country.

Using this model, travel agents only pay Wink's processing fee and Wink will invoice the travel agent on a monthly basis.

## Future services

We will offer optional subscription-based services in the future that make it even easier to sell for everyone or offer managed affiliate accounts that do the selling for you. If that interests you, get your voice heard by emailing us at [hi@wink.travel](mailto:hi@wink.travel).

Stay tuned.

## Platform effect

Finally, as we continue to grow in both size and bookings, we want to be able to share some of the platform effects with you. More bookings bring opportunities for volume discounts from our payment gateway which would allow us to lower our processing fee for everyone.
