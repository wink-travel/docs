This article explains the types of customers we serve and how we are best able to help.

## Properties

Wink started onboarding hotels a decade ago. Hotels use Wink to effectively manage their inventory across 1000s of  sales channels, including their own brand.com site, and to earn more with every booking while boosting direct channels with the help of our hospitality-focused tools that enhance brand identity and profitabilityâ€‹.

## Brands & Chains

Brands and chains have slightly different needs than a single property. On Wink, they can:

- Manage multiple properties under a single account.
- Assign managers to properties
- Use [WinkLinks](/link-manager/wink-links), [WordPress](/developers/wordpress) and our [Web Components](/developers/web-components) to market and sell multiple properties in the one place.

## Management companies

Hospitality management companies and destination management companies can manage their property portfolios on behalf of the owners. There is a definitive advantage to letting online-focused, digitally-aware, agencies handle selling to the online segment while hotels can focus on managing customer satisfaction once they arrive on the premises.

## Influencers

Influencers use Wink to better monetize their audience. They do so by partnering with hotels, creating custom deals, and leveraging Wink's social-friendly tools and powerful analytics to track which products sell bestâ€‹.

## Travel agents

Travel agents get access to travel inventory worldwide at great prices through our dedicated [travel agent portal](https://agent.wink.travel). They can make bookings through our portal, via our API or by letting their users book themselves on the travel agent website that's using our technologies. 

## Corporations

Corporations require more of a travel platform:

- They require well-organized itineraries that support flexibility and last-minute changes.
- They require reliable communication tools, such as internet.
- They have vendor preferences with memberships.
- They often have a corporate credit card and set spending limits.
- The require expense management and reporting integration.
- They need concierge support, as well as, MICE services at events.

Corporate travelers can manage their own accounts on our [corporate portal](/corporate/what-is-group) or use our officially supported [MS Sharepoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration) plugin and [Concur](https://www.concur.com/) integration.

## Developers

While we built this platform by and for hoteliers... Every line of code was built for the specific purpose of re-usability. Our team of developers built Wink in the hopes that the next ðŸ¦„ travel app gets built on top of our code base.
